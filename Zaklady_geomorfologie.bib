  abstract = {A signi®cant sackung-type deep-seated slope gravitational deformation (DSGSD) was recognised for the ®rst time by the authors in the middle part of Valfurva, east of Bormio (Rhaetian Alps, Italy). The reconstruction of its kinematics, age and state of activity is presented, through a detailed description of its morphological, geomechanical and structural features. An integrated multi-disciplinary approach was performed to achieve a clear comprehension of the phenomenon. Field surveys and aero-photo interpretation were carried out in order to clarify the structural, geological and geomorphological setting in which the DSGSD developed. A kinematic conceptual model of the slope deformation was developed through the analysis of morphostructures, of their signi®cance and relationships with lithological markers and Quaternary deposits. After a geomechanical characterisation of the rock mass involved in the slope deformation, numerical modelling was performed to verify the hypotheses made on kinematics and driving factors of the phenomenon. The sackung affects pre-Permian metapelites, metabasites and marbles belonging to the Upper Austroalpine basement of the Campo Nappe, as well as Late Pleistocene and Holocene glacial and rock glacier deposits. The deformation started after the Late-Wurmian age (15,000±11,000 years B.P.), and continued until few centuries ago, not excluding a present-day low-rate activity. Deformation consists in a large oblique ªsaggingº along a deep con®ned sliding surface, associated with gravitational reactivation of pre-existing (late-Alpine and recent) tectonic brittle structures, leading to the formation of N±S and WNW±ESE trending gravitational morpho-structures. The evolution of the WNW±ESE trending system, resulting in asymmetric trenches, led to progressive failure of the lower part of the slope during the last 10,000 years, as testi®ed by large paleo landslide accumulations, and it is still in progress. Numerical modelling indicates post-glacial unloading as the main triggering factor of the slope deformation. The importance of this deepseated slope deformation is enhanced by the occurrence of the 30 Mm3 active ªRuinonº landslide in the lower part of the slope. Such landslide is subjected to rapid evolution and threatens the valley ¯oor, establishing an important risk factor connected to human lives and socio-economic activities. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {We report on experimental studies of the collision process between an incident bead and a three-dimensional granular packing (made of particles identical to the impacting one). The understanding of such a process and the resulting ejection of particles is, in particular, crucial to describe eolian sand transport. We present here an extensive experimental analysis of the collision and ejection process. The analysis is two dimensional in the sense that we determined only the vertical component Vz of the ejection velocity of the splashed particles and the horizontal component Vx lying in the incident plane. We extracted in particular the distribution of the ejection velocities for a wide range of impact angles θi and incident velocity Vi. We show that the mean quadratic horizontal velocity of the splashed particles is almost insensitive to changes in the impact angle and velocity, while the mean quadratic vertical velocity slightly increases with increasing impact velocity (as V1∕2i). Moreover, the mean number of splashed particles per collision is found to be dependent on both the impact angle and velocity, and to scale with the impact speed as V3∕2i. A consequence of these outcomes is that the sum of the kinetic energy of the splashed particles is directly proportional to the kinetic energy of the incident particle. Finally, we provide the bivariate probability distribution function P(Vx,Vz) of the ejection velocities and show that it can be approximated by the product of a log-normal distribution and a circular normal one.},

  abstract = {The South Atlantic conjugate margins are the product of continental rifting and break-up of Pangea, which was made up of different crustal features prior to rifting. This study investigates continental rift initiation and break-up of alternative lithospheric setups, consisting of large segments with different rheological strength, with the use of analogue and numerical modelling. The analogue models investigate the effect of far-field forces on a system that consist of multiple rheological segments, whereas the numerical models include thermal processes and focus on the impact of initial plume emplacement on such a setup.Lithosphere-scale analogue models consisting of two different rheological compartments have been subjected to extensional forces, to understand effect of far-field forces on large rheological heterogeneities in a system within an extensional tectonic regime. The results show that in such a system, the weaker segment accommodates all the extension. At the contact between the two compartments no rift-initiation is observed. In the presence of a strong sub-Moho mantle, the rift evolution consists of two phases. The first phase is a wide or distributed rift event. Once the strong part of the upper mantle has sufficiently weakened, the rift localizes and a narrow rift continues to accommodate the extension. If extension would continue, break-up would happen at the location of the narrow rift, thereby breaking a rather homogenous part within a laterally heterogeneous system. This would result in asymmetric margins with hyperextended, weak crust on both margins.The numerical results show that, in the case of plume-induced continental break-up, the classical ‘central’ mode of break-up, where the break-up centre develops above the plume-impingement point is not the only form of continental break-up. When the mantle anomaly is located off-set from the contact between rheological segments, a ‘shifted’ mode of break-up may develop. In this case, the mantle plume material rises to the base of the lithosphere and migrates laterally to the contact between two rheological segments where rifting initiates. Mantle material that does not reach the spreading centre and remains at lower crustal depths, resemble high density/high velocity bodies at depth found along the South Atlantic margin and providing geometric asymmetry.Further investigation on the exact influence of the initial plume position with respect to the contact between the rheological compartments shows that there is a critical distance for which the system develops either ‘central’ (or ‘plume-induced’) continental break-up or ‘shifted’ (or ‘structural inherited’) continental break-up. For Moho temperatures of 500 – 600 oC, there is a window of \textasciitilde 50 km where the system creates two break-up branches. These results explain complex rift systems with both vertical penetration of plume material into the overlying lithosphere as well as reactivated inherited structures developing break-up systems both aided by the same mantle plume...},

  abstract = {Flysch is a sedimentary rock consisting of a rhythmic alternation of hard (limestone, sandstone, siltstone) and weak (marl, mudstone, claystone) layers. Because of the presence of layers with different physical properties, the mechanical characterization of heterogeneous rock masses such as flysch is a real challenge. Different methods have been proposed in the literature to characterize flysch, combining empirical classification indexes with laboratory tests. Most of these methods, however, were specifically designed for tunneling and underground excavations, and their applicability to slope stability problems is not yet fully investigated. In this study, we analyze a large landslide in a cretaceous flysch rock in order to compare the mobilized strength at failure with those predicted by the modified GSI method (Marinos and Hoek, 2001). The landslide occurred in the Savena River basin (Northern Apennines of Italy) on April 6, 2013, with a volume of about 3~million~m3. Soon after the failure, geological, geotechnical, and geophysical investigations were carried out to detect the failure mechanism and define the landslide geometry. Back analyses of the failed slope were performed using both limit equilibrium and finite difference methods to estimate the in situ strength of the flysch. The results show that the mobilized rock mass cohesion is very low (c'\,≈\,20\,÷\,40~kPa) and that the modified GSI method can predict the in situ strength only assuming a disturbance factor D~=~1. Moreover, the analysis shows that the linearization criteria proposed in literature to compute the equivalent Mohr-Coulomb parameters remarkably overestimate the rock mass strength.},

  abstract = {In 1955, Lane introduced the qualitative expression QwS α QsDs to relate water discharge (Qw), channel slope (S), sediment discharge or load (Qs), and a representative bed sediment size (Ds) for a river reach under dynamic equilibrium conditions. For over 50years, Lane's relation has provided a unique conceptual model useful to engineers, geomorphologists, and educators for visualizing and describing the concept of dynamic equilibrium in rivers. However, the ability of Lane's relation to describe river adjustments is inherently limited because the expression cannot account for the changes in cross-sectional, planform and bedform geometry that are typically associated with complex channel adjustments. By demonstrating that Qs is inversely proportional to the width-to-depth ratio (W/d), we expand Lane's relation to include the width-to-depth ratio as a cross-sectional geometry term: QwS α QsDs (W/d). We further demonstrate that the slope term (S) is proportional to the total change in elevation along a channel (∆z) and inversely proportional to sinuosity (P) and bedform amplitude (H¯a): S α ∆z/(PH¯a). The introduction of the width-to-depth ratio and expressing channel slope in terms of channel geometry expands the original Lane's relation to explicitly include measures of cross-sectional, planform and bedform geometry as additional degrees of freedom. This significantly broadens the usefulness of Lane's original relation as a conceptual model and allows the visualization of complex river responses that commonly involve adjustments to cross-sectional, planform, and/or bedform geometry.},

The fouling layer consisted of particulate matter embedded in an apparently amorphous matrix, which was unevenly distributed over the membrane surface with the greatest accumulation in the valley areas. Inorganic and organic foulants were identified in the RO membranes. Inorganic foulants mainly consisted of hydrogen aluminosilicates and halite. The main organics substances identified were proteins, polysaccharides and humic compounds and were attributed to biofouling. Chemical analysis revealed that Si, Al, Cl, Ca, Na, Mg and K were the predominant elements contributing to membrane fouling. The reasons for the deposition of foulants on the RO membranes are the increase of membrane selectivity due to biofouling, the large size of cartridge filters and the high operating pressure.},

In the absence of ice sheet reconstructions, researchers often use marine δ18O proxy records to infer ice volume prior to the LGM. We present a global ice sheet reconstruction for the past 80\,000 years, called PaleoMIST 1.0, constructed independently of far-field sea level and δ18O proxy records. Our reconstruction is compatible with LGM far-field sea-level records without requiring extra ice volume, thus solving the missing ice problem. However, for Marine Isotope Stage 3 (57\,000-29\,000 years before present) - a pre-LGM period - our reconstruction does not match proxy-based sea level reconstructions, indicating the relationship between marine δ18O and sea level may be more complex than assumed.},

  abstract = {Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth’s glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000–2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267~±~16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21~±~3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48~±~16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7–9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

The primary recommendation is to modify the definition of landslide-forming materials, to provide compatibility with accepted geotechnical and geological terminology of rocks and soils. Other, less important modifications of the classification system are suggested, resulting from recent developments of the landslide science. The modified Varnes classification of landslides has 32 landslide types, each of which is backed by a formal definition. The definitions should facilitate backward compatibility of the system as well as possible translation to other languages. Complex landslides are not included as a separate category type, but composite types can be constructed by the user of the classification by combining two or more type names, if advantageous.},

  abstract = {An inventory of 846 mass movements, mainly landslides, in two alpine regions of southwest New Zealand was created to explore the geomorphic impacts of slope-failure processes on river channels and valley floors. In total, 213 (i.e. 27 per cent) of the slope failures descended to valley floors, affecting the geomorphology of trunk channels (catchment area AC {$>$} 10 km2) and valley floors in recurring patterns. A nominal classification system is introduced for characterizing (a) the physical contact nature between landslides and river channels, and (b) the resulting geomorphic consequences for drainage. Although landslide area A is useful for estimating the length of channel directly impacted by debris, it does not necessarily predict the direction of fluvial response or type of impact. Dominant persistent geomorphic imprints of bedrock landslides include channel occlusions and landslide dams in South Westland and Fiordland, respectively. Differences in size distribution and geomorphic effects on river systems between the two study regions are attributed to bedrock geology, tectonics and sediment flux. Although South Westland rivers are more frequently affected by landslides, disrupting long-term effects such as blockage are more persistent in Fiordland. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Traditionally, loesses are classified as glacial, desert, or other types based only on source area characteristics without taking into account provenance and transportation. Research on loess genesis is often local with only a few attempts at systematically overviewing worldwide loess distribution. Both the local and few global studies lack information on the variability in loess thickness, continuity, and areal extent. This review integrates a large body of information on loess source areas and transportation pathways and the existence of desert transition zones. Three modes of loess genesis, (1) continental glacier provenance-river transport, (2) mountain provenance-river transport, and (3) mountain provenance-river transport-desert transition, were identified. Global distribution maps of provenance and transport pathways of major loess areas and their different genesis modes were meticulously prepared. Maps showing the spatial distribution, thickness, and continuity of loess deposits were also composed and the sizes of loess-covered areas of each continent were re-estimated. The main features related to the distribution of the loess deposits on each continent are summarized for different regions or as a whole depending on the coverage of the source maps and references.},

  abstract = {Field data on the rates of solifluction and associated parameters are compiled from the literature, in an attempt to evaluate factors controlling the spatial variability in solifluction processes and landforms, with special attention on the climate–solifluction relationship. The analyzed data originate from 46 sites over a wide range of periglacial environments, from Antarctic nunataks to tropical high mountains. Solifluction, broadly defined as slow mass wasting resulting from freeze–thaw action in fine-textured soils, involves several components: needle ice creep and diurnal frost creep originating from diurnal freeze–thaw action; annual frost creep, gelifluction and plug-like flow originating from annual freeze–thaw action; and retrograde movement caused by soil cohesion. The depth and thickness of ice lenses and freeze–thaw frequency are the major controls on the spatial variation in solifluction processes. Near the warm margin of the solifluction-affected environment, diurnal freeze–thaw action induces shallow but relatively rapid movement of a superficial layer 5–10 cm thick on average, often creating the thin stone-banked lobes typically seen on tropical high mountains. In addition to diurnal movement, annual frost creep and gelifluction may occur on slopes with soil climates of seasonal frost to warm permafrost, dislocating a soil layer shallower than 60 cm at a rate of centimeters per year and eventually producing medium-size solifluction lobes. In High-Arctic cold permafrost regions, two-sided freezing can induce plug-like flow of a soil mass 60 cm or thicker. The correlation between process and landform suggests that the riser height of lobes is indicative of the maximum depth of movement and prevailing freeze–thaw type. Climate change may result in new different ground freezing conditions, thereby influencing the surface velocity and maximum depth of soil movement. Soil moisture and topography also control solifluction. High moisture availability in the seasonal freezing period enhances diurnal freeze–thaw action and subsequent seasonal frost heaving. The latter contributes to raising the moisture content of the thawed layer and promotes gelifluction during the thawing period. The slope angle defines the upper limit of the surface velocity of solifluction. A diagram correlating the potential frost creep with the actual surface velocity permits an inter-site comparison of the relative magnitude of solifluction components. Physically based modelling of periglacial slope evolution requires synthetic and more detailed field monitoring and laboratory simulations of solifluction processes. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Assessing landslide causes is useful for hazard analysis, mitigation of slope instability, and for considering the role of landslides in landscape systems and evolution. Geological and geomorphological conditions (e.g., material type, strength and structure, and slope angle) predispose slopes to failure; knowledge of these conditions can help to predict the location, types, and volumes of potential failures. Determining when a slope will fail is a considerably more difficult challenge, largely due to the difficulty of observing or predicting the processes of material strength degradation. This chapter describes concepts of stability and explores some of the major causes and triggers of slope failure and opportunities for further research.},

  abstract = {Aeolian mineral dust is an important component of the Earth’s environmental systems, playing roles in the planetary radiation balance, as a source of fertilizer for biota in both terrestrial and marine realms and as an archive for understanding atmospheric circulation and paleoclimate in the geologic past. Crucial to understanding all of these roles of dust is the identification of dust sources. Here we review the methods used to identify dust sources active at present and in the past. Contemporary dust sources, produced by both glaciogenic and non-glaciogenic processes, can be readily identified by the use of Earth-orbiting satellites. These data show that present dust sources are concentrated in a global dust belt that encompasses large topographic basins in low-latitude arid and semiarid regions. Geomorphic studies indicate that specific point sources for dust in this zone include dry or ephemeral lakes, intermittent stream courses, dune fields, and some bedrock surfaces. Back-trajectory analyses are also used to identify dust sources, through modeling of wind fields and the movement of air parcels over periods of several days. Identification of dust sources from the past requires novel approaches that are part of the geologic toolbox of provenance studies. Identification of most dust sources of the past requires the use of physical, mineralogical, geochemical, and isotopic analyses of dust deposits. Physical properties include systematic spatial changes in dust deposit thickness and particle size away from a source. Mineralogy and geochemistry can pinpoint dust sources by clay mineral ratios and Sc-Th-La abundances, respectively. The most commonly used isotopic methods utilize isotopes of Nd, Sr, and Pb and have been applied extensively in dust archives of deep-sea cores, ice cores, and loess. All these methods have shown that dust sources have changed over time, with far more abundant dust supplies existing during glacial periods. Greater dust supplies in glacial periods are likely due to greater production of glaciogenic dust particles from expanded ice sheets and mountain glaciers, but could also include dust inputs from exposed continental and insular shelves now submerged. Future dust sources are difficult to assess, but will likely differ from those of the present because of global warming. Global warming could bring about shifts in dust sources by changes in degree or type of vegetation cover, changes in wind strength, and increases or decreases in the size of water bodies. A major uncertainty in assessing dust sources of the future is related to changes in human land use, which could affect land surface cover, particularly due to increased agricultural endeavors and water usage.},

  abstract = {Permafrost is a key element of the cryosphere and an essential climate variable in the Global Climate Observing System. There is no remote-sensing method available to reliably monitor the permafrost thermal state. To estimate permafrost distribution at a hemispheric scale, we employ an equilibrium state model for the temperature at the top of the permafrost (TTOP model) for the 2000–2016 period, driven by remotely-sensed land surface temperatures, down-scaled ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data, tundra wetness classes and landcover map from the ESA Landcover Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project. Subgrid variability of ground temperatures due to snow and landcover variability is represented in the model using subpixel statistics. The results are validated against borehole measurements and reviewed regionally. The accuracy of the modelled mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the top of the permafrost is ±2\,°C when compared to permafrost borehole data. The modelled permafrost area (MAGT {$<$}0\,°C) covers 13.9\,×\,106\,km2 (ca. 15\% of the exposed land area), which is within the range or slightly below the average of previous estimates. The sum of all pixels having isolated patches, sporadic, discontinuous or continuous permafrost (permafrost probability {$>$}0) is around 21\,×\,106\,km2 (22\% of exposed land area), which is approximately 2\,×\,106\,km2 less than estimated previously. Detailed comparisons at a regional scale show that the model performs well in sparsely vegetated tundra regions and mountains, but is less accurate in densely vegetated boreal spruce and larch forests.},

The understanding of such a process and the resulting ejection of grains is, in particular, crucial to describe aeolian sand transport. We present here recent experimental results on the collision and ejection process when varying the angle and the speed of the incident bead. We performed numerical simulations of one bead collisions on the surface of a static granular medium. The simulations have been done for two and three dimensional packings of beads. The effects of the incident bead velocity, the shot angle, the mechanical parameters and the packing structure are analyzed for ordered and disordered 2D packings but only disordered 3D packings. The 2D results are in good agreement with available experimental data. The 3D simulations give good preliminary results about the shock wave propagation through the stacking and provides new insights in the ejection process (“splash function”).},

Because of the variable composition of such rock masses, the availability of both petrographic and mechanical features of the intact rock is essential in order to carry out geomechanical studies. Starting from the detailed evaluation of the strength and deformability of the intact rock, the GSI method was applied to the Sanremo flysch formation, which is widely outcropping in Western Italy and involved in many engineering projects. It is characterized by both a remarkable lithological heterogeneity and a structural complexity. Petrographic analysis and laboratory tests allowed the definition of the main constituent lithotypes and the identification of their mechanical properties, whereas geomechanical surveys were performed in order to estimate the GSI values and the strong/weak ratio. Based on the frequency of strong and weak layers, a “weighted average” of intact rock values was used in estimating the rock mass parameters. Three main rock mass classes were identified, and a basic engineering geological map of the study area was prepared.},

  abstract = {Soils in the Amazon Basin are deficient in phosphorus, essential to soil fertility. Previous studies suggested that African mineral dust deposited to Amazonian soils served as an important source of phosphorus that enhances soil fertility. These studies lacked the quantitative measurements essential to validate estimates. Here we present daily measurements of mineral dust and PM10 carried in the trade winds at Cayenne, French Guiana, during 2002–2017. MERRA-2 model dust concentrations showed excellent agreement with measurements over this period. Consequently, we used MERRA-2 to estimate temporal and spatial deposition rates to Amazonia. Our annual deposition rate, 8–10 Tg dust, is substantially lower than previous estimates. Deposition rates are greatest over the northern and northeastern regions of South America. In contrast, rates are low in central Amazonia. Our results raise questions about the impact of African dust on soil fertility in Amazonia. However, African aerosol transport carries other aerosol species that could play a role in soil fertility, including biomass-burning products known to contain substantial concentrations of phosphorus. Our study highlights the need for more measurements of aerosol and precipitation chemistry over wider expanses of South America in order to better characterize aerosol chemical and physical properties, to identify aerosol sources, and to constrain model estimates. We show that over 2002–2017 dust transport to South America was negatively correlated to rainfall over the Sahel in North Africa. Long-term monitoring is needed to capture changes in transport from Africa that might occur as a result of climate change.},

On the top of the granulometry and hydrodynamics survey there were also the chemical properties of the sediments, including heavy metals, examined. The main conclusion of the paper is that a point bar (developed on the river band) is less stable, than an up-of the obstruction bar (an alternate bar) developed along the river bank. Also there are number of observations connected with the hydrodynamics influence on stream bars formation.

The basal fault scarp is rejuvenated by vertical movements recurring at intervals on the order of 10 000 years. Fault scarps in colluvium that lie within a few tens of meters of the base of faceted spurs remain clearly recognizable for only a few tens of thousand years. Initial fault-scarp slopes of 50° to 90° are replaced by debris-controlled slopes of 30° to 37° within a few thousand years. In fractured bedrock, slope angles in the range of 25° to 35° remain relatively stable for hundreds of thousands of years and account for the relative stability of facets on spurs. Piedmont slopes are greatly affected by tectonic tilting or warping toward or away from the range front. The formation of pediments is believed to result from a low ratio of uplift relative to downcutting. A few million years is required for the development of a pediment a few kilometers wide.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic collapse of large rock slopes ranks as one of the most hazardous natural phenomena in mountain landscapes. The cascade of events, from rock-slope failure, to rock avalanche and the near-immediate release of debris flows has not previously been described from direct observations. We report on the 2017, 3.0×106m3 failure on Pizzo Cengalo in Switzerland, which led to human casualties and significant damage to infrastructure. Based on remote sensing and field investigations, we find a change in critical slope stability prior to failure for which permafrost may have played a destabilizing role. The resulting rock avalanche traveled for 3.2km and removed over one million m3 of glacier ice and debris deposits from a previous rock avalanche in 2011. Whereas this entrainment did not lead to an unusually large runout distance, it favored debris flow activity from the 2017 rock avalanche deposits: the first debris flow occurred with a delay of 30s followed by ten debris flows within 9.5h and two additional events two days later, notably in the absence of rainfall. We hypothesize that entrainment and impact loading of saturated sediments explain the initial mobility of the 2017 rock avalanche deposits leading to a near-immediate initiation of debris flows. This explains why an earlier rock avalanche at the same site in 2011 was not directly followed by debris flows and underlines the importance of considering sediment saturation in a rock avalanche’s runout path for Alpine hazard assessments.},

The angular relationships between the resultant of sand shifting winds and both the crest and principal slipfaces of the elemental types have been discussed qualitatively for many decades. These relationships have been quantified but the wide range of dune types that combine the elemental forms, and the juxtaposition of different dune types, show that wind regime is not the only determinant; for example, sand availability has been considered important. We have now quantified the importance of both wind regime and sand availability as determinants of dune type. We show here that the four elemental types occur in areas uniquely defined by both the equivalent sand thickness of sediments held in the dunes and a measure of directional variability of sand-moving winds. Wind strength does not appear to be important, vegetation has an ambiguous role, and the particle size of dune sediments is unimportant.},
