  abstract = {A number of large rock avalanches from the northern slope of the 1435 m high mountain of Vora in Breim, inner Nordfjord have been mapped. The avalanche tongues dam the 4 km long Sandalsvatnet, they cover an area of 3 km2 and the volume exceeds 100 million m3. Age estimates have been obtained by radiocarbon datings of rock dust layers in a bog and the Schmidt-hammer method. Altogether 11 large rock avalanches have occurred throughout the Holocene, of which six lobes can be recognized morphologically. Five silt laminae in a 5.5 m deep bog basin distally to the avalanche lobes are interpreted as primary sediments from dust clouds generated by rock avalanches. In addition three silt beds are interpreted as glaciolacustrine sediments related to temporary damming caused by landsliding. Average avalanche frequency during the Holocene was c. 1 per 1000 yr and during the period 7100–3600 BP it was c. 1 per 700 yr. After 3600 BP no rock avalanches have been recognized.},

  abstract = {The Flims rockslide/rock avalanche is the largest long runout landslide in Europe. This event provides a unique opportunity to study the pre-failure and failure behavior of a large rock slope, as both the source zone and deposit of this event are accessible. In this study, we perform engineering geological and geomorphic field mapping as well as stability and runout modelling in order to explore the preconditioning and triggering factors that resulted in failure of this event, and to infer the mechanisms that governed its runout. By combining these analyses, we qualitatively comment on the mechanisms that lead to the transition from a rockslide to a long runout, catastrophic rock avalanche. Our engineering geological and geomorphic field mapping has revealed that the Flims rockslide/rock avalanche failed along a sliding zone that features numerous, large scale steps. Previous work at the site, as well as new analysis of thin sections, has revealed the presence of marl-like layers within the failed stratigraphic unit. Our stability analysis shows that the presence of low strength layers at the depth of the rupture surface is required for failure to initiate, and that failure could be triggered either by strong seismic shaking, elevated pore-water pressures, or a combination of both. The results of the runout analysis show that this event likely remained coherent for a large portion of its motion, and that liquefaction of alluvial sediments at the toe of the slope may have enhanced the runout distance of this rock avalanche. Combining the mapping, stability and runout modelling has shown that the basal shear strength required for the runout analysis is approximately 6° to 10° lower than that back-analysed for the stability of this event. Thus, a mechanism to reduce strength along the rupture surface immediately following the initial instability was required for catastrophic failure of this event. This mechanism is poorly understood at present, but is likely crucial for understanding the transition from an initially stable slope to a catastrophic, long runout rock avalanche.},

  abstract = {As the permafrost region warms, its large organic carbon pool will be increasingly vulnerable to decomposition, combustion, and hydrologic export. Models predict that some portion of this release will be offset by increased production of Arctic and boreal biomass; however, the lack of robust estimates of net carbon balance increases the risk of further overshooting international emissions targets. Precise empirical or model-based assessments of the critical factors driving carbon balance are unlikely in the near future, so to address this gap, we present estimates from 98 permafrost-region experts of the response of biomass, wildfire, and hydrologic carbon flux to climate change. Results suggest that contrary to model projections, total permafrost-region biomass could decrease due to water stress and disturbance, factors that are not adequately incorporated in current models. Assessments indicate that end-of-the-century organic carbon release from Arctic rivers and collapsing coastlines could increase by 75\% while carbon loss via burning could increase four-fold. Experts identified water balance, shifts in vegetation community, and permafrost degradation as the key sources of uncertainty in predicting future system response. In combination with previous findings, results suggest the permafrost region will become a carbon source to the atmosphere by 2100 regardless of warming scenario but that 65\%–85\% of permafrost carbon release can still be avoided if human emissions are actively reduced.},

  abstract = {Rb-Sr and K-Ar whole-rock ages of low-grade zeolite — prehnite-pumpellyite facies metasedimentary sequences are reported from the Torlesse Terrane in the Wellington region, North Island, New Zealand. These studies reveal a latest Triassic to earliest Jurassic (225-200 Ma) age of burial metamorphism for the older Rakaia Subterrane, with postmetamorphic uplift and cooling continuing through to Middle Jurassic (c. 170 Ma). A small (c. 20 m.y.) age decrease from the west to east (i.e. to the western boundary of the Esk Head Subterrane, which divides the Rakaia Subterrane from the younger Pahau Subterrane) is related to eastward-migrating imbrication of the accretionary prism. Narrow zones of semischistose (textural zone IIA-B) slates and phyllites within the Rakaia Subterrane are consistently associated with the youngest radiometric ages (135100 Ma). These zones of later tectonism were associated with local thermal overprints in Early Cretaceous times, related to imbrication of the Pahau Subterrane. The Pahau Subterrane developed in Late Jurassic - Early Cretaceous times and underwent low-grade metamorphism 100-85 m.y. ago. Initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios for Rakaia Subterrane metaturbidites are in the range 0.7065-0.7098 over the 225170 m.y. age range, and are consistent with the postulated continental arc/cratonic source for the older part of the Torlesse Terrane. Similar initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.70650.7088) for the Pahau Subterrane over a younger age range (145-85 m.y.) are inconsistent with the Rakaia Subterrane being a dominant sediment source for the Pahau Subterrane through reworking.},

While it may be assumed that glaciers increased erosion rates when active, the degree to which past glaciations influence Holocene erosion rates through the adjustment of topography is not known. In this study, we investigate the influence of long-term tectonic and post-glacial topographic controls on erosion in a glaciated orogen: the Olympic Mountains, USA. We present 14 new 10Be and 26Al analyses which constrain Holocene erosion rates across the Olympic Mountains. Basin-averaged erosion rates scale with basin-averaged values of 5 km local relief, channel steepness, and hillslope angle throughout the range, similar to observations from non-glaciated orogens. These erosion rates are not related to mean annual precipitation or the marked change in Pleistocene alpine glacier size across the range, implying that glacier modification of topography and modern precipitation parameters do not exert strong controls on these rates. Rather, we find that despite spatial variations in glacial modification of topography, patterns of recent erosion are similar to those from estimates of long-term tectonic rock uplift. This is consistent with a tectonic model where erosion and rock uplift patterns are controlled by the deformation of the Cascadia subduction zone.},

Traditionally kinematic analysis is performed after plotting discontinuity orientations, slope angle, slope azimuth and representative friction angle value on a stereonet. Due to large number of discontinuities, only representative orientation values (dip/dip direction) for identified cluster sets are considered. This stereonet-based analysis is qualitative in nature and requires the presence of tight data clusters for which a reasonable representative orientation value can be assigned. However, there are cases when a tight circular clustering of discontinuity orientations does not exist, making stereonetbased analysis unreliable. Also, variability of discontinuity data in cluster sets is not easy to consider using the stereonet-based method.},

  abstract = {The interplay of tectonic and climatic forcing in the development of Alpine deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSD) is still poorly understood. We investigate a giant DSGSD affecting the Piz Dora slope (Val Müstair, Switzerland) by geological, structural and geomorphological analyses, spaceborne SAR interferometry and numerical modelling. The DSGSD affects Permian terrigenous and volcanoclastic successions folded into a kilometre-scale asymmetric anticline during the Alpine orogenesis. The area is characterized by active tectonic uplift and widespread shallow seismicity with dominant dip-slip fault mechanisms, experienced fast deglaciation after the Last Glacial Maximum and periglacial conditions between the Lateglacial and Holocene. The slope is affected by morpho-structural features testifying to the deep-seated gravitational sliding of 1.85km3 of rock along a basal shear zone over 400m deep. Analysis of rock glaciers and DInSAR data show that the DSGSD was active in Lateglacial times and is presently deforming at rates ö 15mm/yr. Integrated kinematic analysis of field and radar data outlines a key control of the inherited fold structure on the DSGSD, with a transition from deep compound sliding to the West, controlled by massive conglomerates (Chazforà Formation), to shallower roto-translational sliding to the East, controlled by volcanoclastic foliated rocks (Ruina Formation). 2DFEM stress-strain numerical models, simulating the post-LGM slope evolution in static, pseudo-static and dynamic conditions allowed evaluating the contribution of long-term seismicity to DSGSD in a paraglacial setting. Dynamic modelling was performed starting from the characterization of a real earthquake, representative of the recent local seismotectonic activity, and scaled to obtain dynamic scenarios with different return periods. Results suggest that deglaciation-related perturbations promoted the inception of the DSGSD but not its complete development, that was likely stimulated by the long-term contribution of recurrent, small earthquakes. Our results suggest that inherited structures, active seismicity and deglaciation cooperate to promote paraglacial rock slope deformation in tectonically active Alpine settings.},

  abstract = {Landslides influence local slope morphology, affect sediment flux from hillslopes to rivers, and mass wasting in response to tectonics and climate forcing. However, the links between giant, noncatastrophic landslides known as Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformations (DSGSDs) and the long-term evolution of orogenic landscapes are almost unknown. We explore these links in the European Alps using the first orogen-scale inventory of DSGSDs ( 4 900 over an area 4105 km2) and a dataset of published apatite fission-track ages (4 1000) that provides an estimate of the long-term exhumation patterns of the orogen. We show that DSGSDs are more widespread than previously considered, and exhibit an orogen-scale distribution not explained by well-known local lithological and structural controls. We test the hypothesis that this orogen-scale distribution correlates to the longterm evolution of the Alps by subdividing the study area into 37 square sub-areas (50 Â 50 km), classified according to combinations of long-term exhumation and mean annual rainfall. On each subarea we perform a morphometric analysis of topography (hypsometry, relief, slope). Excluding local and regional controls due to rock type and structure, DSGSDs tend to cluster in areas with intermediate exhumation rates (fission-track age between 10 and 40 Ma), where large-scale topography is less dissected and incision is localised along major valleys. Here DSGSD abundance correlates positively with the degree of valley incision and related relief. Instead, DSGSDs lack in areas which underwent either low exhumation rates, resulting in insufficient relief production, or high exhumation rates associated to rapid uplift or higher erosional dissection of topography. Negative correlation between DSGSD abundance and mean annual rainfall suggests that effective hydrological surface processes contribute, on the long-term timescale, to the development of large-scale topography unfavourable to DSGSDs, especially in areas of high exhumation rates. Where DSGSDs are abundant, long-lasting slope deformations effectively adjust post-glacial relief by reducing slope inclination values, and are thus expected to significantly contribute to the long-term denudation of active orogens.},

The code is based on a kinematic algorithm and allows to run detailed, spatially distributed simulations of rockfall on a three-dimensional topography described by a Digital Elevation Model. Two examples from the Central Italian Alps, both characterised by the occurrence of frequent historical events, valuable elements at risk (urban areas, corridors) and countermeasures (barriers and retaining walls) are presented.

  abstract = {A signi®cant sackung-type deep-seated slope gravitational deformation (DSGSD) was recognised for the ®rst time by the authors in the middle part of Valfurva, east of Bormio (Rhaetian Alps, Italy). The reconstruction of its kinematics, age and state of activity is presented, through a detailed description of its morphological, geomechanical and structural features. An integrated multi-disciplinary approach was performed to achieve a clear comprehension of the phenomenon. Field surveys and aero-photo interpretation were carried out in order to clarify the structural, geological and geomorphological setting in which the DSGSD developed. A kinematic conceptual model of the slope deformation was developed through the analysis of morphostructures, of their signi®cance and relationships with lithological markers and Quaternary deposits. After a geomechanical characterisation of the rock mass involved in the slope deformation, numerical modelling was performed to verify the hypotheses made on kinematics and driving factors of the phenomenon. The sackung affects pre-Permian metapelites, metabasites and marbles belonging to the Upper Austroalpine basement of the Campo Nappe, as well as Late Pleistocene and Holocene glacial and rock glacier deposits. The deformation started after the Late-Wurmian age (15,000±11,000 years B.P.), and continued until few centuries ago, not excluding a present-day low-rate activity. Deformation consists in a large oblique ªsaggingº along a deep con®ned sliding surface, associated with gravitational reactivation of pre-existing (late-Alpine and recent) tectonic brittle structures, leading to the formation of N±S and WNW±ESE trending gravitational morpho-structures. The evolution of the WNW±ESE trending system, resulting in asymmetric trenches, led to progressive failure of the lower part of the slope during the last 10,000 years, as testi®ed by large paleo landslide accumulations, and it is still in progress. Numerical modelling indicates post-glacial unloading as the main triggering factor of the slope deformation. The importance of this deepseated slope deformation is enhanced by the occurrence of the 30 Mm3 active ªRuinonº landslide in the lower part of the slope. Such landslide is subjected to rapid evolution and threatens the valley ¯oor, establishing an important risk factor connected to human lives and socio-economic activities. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) influence landscape development in tectonically active mountain ranges. Nevertheless, the relationships among tectonics, DSGSDs, and topography are poorly known. In this paper, the distribution of DSGSDs and their relationships with tectonic structures and active processes, surface processes, and topography were investigated at different scales. Over 100 DSGSDs were mapped in a 5000 km2 sector of the central Eastern Alps between the Valtellina, Engadine and Venosta valleys. Detailed lineament mapping was carried out by photo-interpretation in a smaller area (about 750 km2) including the upper Valtellina and Val Venosta. Fault populations were also analysed in the field and their mechanisms unravelled, allowing to identify different structural stages, the youngest being consistent with the regional pattern of the ongoing crustal deformation. Finally, four DSGSD examples have been investigated in detail by geological and 2D geomechanical modelling.},

  abstract = {Mass wasting and tectonic uplift are the major factors, responsible for reshaping the northern Pakistan that contains the world’s most steeply inclined mountainous regions including: Karakoram, Himalayas, and Hindukush Ranges. The role of GIS and remote sensing is inevitable to study the river geomorphology for the identification and evaluation of different mass wasting processes. digital elevation models (DEMs) are frequently used to extract the longitudinal profile of the rivers to identify the knickpoints and their related geomorphic attributes. For this study, ASTER DEM of 30~m spatial resolution satellite data was utilized to perform the geomorphological analysis of the longitudinal profile of the Hunza River in ArcGIS and Matlab environment. The Hunza River channel with having the watershed area of 13571~km2, has witnessed a number of historic landslide dams (i.e. Attabad, Ganesh and Boultar glacier, etc.) that blocked the main river channel at multiple sections in different episodes of time. These past landslides presumably preserved in the river channel as knickpoints at their respective locations. In this study, a total of 77 knickpoints were identified along the main stem of the river channel. The spatial locations of the extracted knickpoints and their normalized steepness index (ks) values were compared with the Hunza River landslide inventory map, lithologic contact, tectonic faults and historic landslides data. Furthermore, the likely role of these geomorphic factors was evaluated to ascertain their association with knickpoints formation. The results of this GIS-based geomorphic analysis of the river profile and subsequent field visit of the area revealed that the formation of landslide dams and their subsequent breaching is one of the major trigger factor of knickpoints along the channel. Such studies highlight the benefits of inexpensive remote sensing data and GIS tools to assess the likely role of various geomorphic features in the formation of significant knickpoints along the river profiles on a regional scale.},

  abstract = {On 12 September AD 1717, a rock volume larger than 10 million m3 collapsed onto the Triolet Glacier, mobilized a mass composed of ice and sediment and travelled more than 7 km downvalley in the upper Ferret Valley, Mont Blanc Massif (Italy). This rock avalanche destroyed two small settlements, causing seven casualties and loss of livestock. No detailed maps were made at the time. Later investigators attributed accumulations of granitic boulders and irregular ridges on the upper valley floor to either glacial deposition, or the AD 1717 rock avalanche, or a complex mixture of glacial deposition, earlier rock avalanche and AD 1717 rock avalanche origin. In this study, we present cosmogenic 10Be exposure ages from nine boulders in the extensive chaotic boulder deposit with irregular ridges, two from Holocene glacier-free areas, and one from a Little Ice Age moraine. Exposure ages between 330 Æ 23 and 483 Æ 123 a from eight of nine boulders from the chaotic deposit indicate that at least seven were deposited by the AD 1717 rock avalanche. The other three boulders yielded 10Be exposure ages of 10 900 Æ 400, 9700 Æ 400 and 244 Æ 97 a, respectively. Our results are in good agreement with the existing chronology from dendrochronology and lichenometry, and radiocarbon analysis of wood samples, but not with older 14C ages from a peat bog in the upper part of the valley. Based on the new age control, the rock avalanche deposits cover the whole bottom of the upper Ferret valley. Copyright \# 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We report on the usefulness of principal components substitution (PCS) to merge IRS panchromatic data with multispectral Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, to map commonly encountered desert geomorphological features, and in relative age dating of alluvial surfaces. The merged data were applied to the identification and mapping of geomorphological features along two geologically different mountain fronts in central Saudi Arabia. Two types of geomorphological maps have been created. A morphogenetic map that distinguishes between aeolian landforms, fluvial landforms, desert pavements, and gypsum crusts. Second, a morphochronological map, which shows the relative age of four geomorphic surfaces developed on an alluvial fan. The construction of the two maps is supported by field observations and laboratory measurements. Using the optimum index factor (OIF), a TM band 1, 5 and 7 image (of 20 merged composites) was found to be the optimum colour composite image for the geomorphological features in this arid environment. We discuss our findings in the context of the spatial and spectral properties required for applied geomorphological remote sensing.},

The research allowed us to define the relations between the diversity of the landslide-originating landforms and the biotopes occurring within them. High geodiversity (diversity of landforms, soil, and water) of landslide areas allows for a mosaic network of extremely diversified natural habitats. All of these natural habitats together, are characterized by a specific biodiversity. Dependence between geo- and biodiversity in landslide areas is connected with a specific coevolution which is related to the adaptation of the ecosystems to landforms. Comprehensive research of this relation to landslide areas would promote the necessity to protect the landslide areas. Unfortunately, such research done in the Carpathians is still sporadic. The comprehensively documented landslide areas are especially valuable elements of the nature protection network within the Carpathian Euro-region.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The study of European and Russian Quaternary glacial-geological evidence during the last 15 years has generated sufficient data to use former glacial extent as a proxy for Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate (precipitation and temperature) at a continental scale. Utilisation of such data is relevant for two reasons. First, continental to global scale proxy reconstructions of past climate are an important tool in the assessment of retrospective general circulation model (GCM) simulations. Second, the development of a multi-proxy approach will result in a more robust proxy based climate signal. A new and independent dataset of 36 LGM precipitation and temperature relationships derived from European and Russian mountain regions is presented in this paper. A simple glacier-climate model was used to establish the optimum LGM precipitation/temperature conditions for each region from a suite of over 4000 model climates using the principle of zero cumulative mass balance. Clear regional trends are present in the reconstructed LGM precipitation and temperature curves; assuming present precipitation temperature anomalies north of the Alps are 2\&deg;C and 5\&deg;C larger than those in the western and eastern Mediterranean, respectively. In Russia the model results suggest that the climates in both the Arctic Urals and Puterana Plateau were probably conducive to the existence of small mountain glaciers at the LGM.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The modelling approach does not appear to have been used before in a geomorphological context and provides an alternative approach for examining cliff development. Field and laboratory data have been collected for the Portland Limestone outcrop of the Isle of Purbeck, central southern England. The Portland Limestone is a hard, shelly, crystalline sediment of the Upper Jurassic. It has a regular discontinuity pattern throughout the outcrop in Purbeck. While joint orientation remains relatively constant, bedding changes from horizontal to vertical, a consequence of the Purbeck Monocline. There are resulting implications for spatial variations in rock slope evolution. The modelling exercise enhances previous knowledge on rock failure mechanisms and slope development along the Purbeck coast and demonstrates its potential in research where landforms are developed in lithified, jointed rock masses. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In the case of Pamplona marls, a number of large-scale direct shear tests on natural and saturated specimens of the undisturbed material were performed. Tests on marl– concrete interfaces were performed and are also presented. Both cases analysed show that the saturation of the marl leads to a strong reduction of friction and effective cohesion. Negative effects of suction changes on the mechanical behaviour of the marls were investigated in more detail in suction controlled tests on Abadia marls, a more plastic material. A numerical simulation of wetting effects on a marl fragment of finite size helps to identify the nature of degradation mechanisms, which are associated with the development of tensile surfaces inside the marl matrix. They, in turn, are due to the expansive behaviour of the clay fraction of the marl relative to suction changes.},

  abstract = {Although it has been tacitly assumed since the seminal work of Jones in the 1930s that slump folds bear a systematic and meaningful relationship to the slope upon which they were presumably created, there has in reality been very little attempt to objectively verify this association via the collection of regional slump data in a relatively controlled setting. The potential to walk around the intact Dead Sea Basin at c. 425\,m below mean sea level provides a perhaps unparalleled opportunity to undertake such verification via the direct examination of slump fold relationships. The collection of slump data in this well-constrained environment, where the seismogenic trigger for slumping is established via earthquake records, and the palaeogeographical controls are also recognizable and clearly link to the present bathymetry and landscape, thereby permits an evaluation of the use of slump folds as indicators of palaeoslope. The Late Pleistocene Lisan Formation cropping out to the west of the Dead Sea contains superb examples of slump folds that systematically face ({$>$}95\%) and verge ({$>$}90\%) towards the east. This study employs and evaluates five statistical techniques, including a new mean axial-planar dip (MAD) method, to analyse relationships between the orientation of slump folds and palaeoslopes. We recognize for the first time that the direction of slumping inferred from slump folds and thrusts varies systematically along the entire c. 100\,km length of the western Dead Sea Basin. SE-directed slumping is preserved in the north, easterly directed slumping in the central portion and NE-directed slumping at the southern end of the Dead Sea. They are interpreted to form part of a large-scale and newly recognized radial slump system directed towards the depocentre of the precursor to the Dead Sea, and to be triggered by earthquakes associated with seismicity along the Dead Sea Fault.},

  abstract = {The Late Pleistocene Lisan Formation contains superb examples of soft-sediment deformation generated during gravity-driven slumping and failure down extremely gentle (b1°) slopes towards the palaeo-Dead Sea Basin. Following a previously established framework, portions of individual slumps are broadly categorised into coherent, semi-coherent, and incoherent domains, reflecting increasing deformation and disarticulation of sediment. We present new structural data collected from each of these (overlapping) domains that demonstrate how the orientation of fold hinges and axial planes becomes more dispersed as slumps become increasingly incoherent. Such patterns are the reverse to that typically encountered in lithified rocks where increasing deformation results in clustering of linear elements towards the flow direction, and may reflect greater heterogeneity and disarticulation within slumps. Use of folds to determine palaeoslopes should therefore be limited to those from coherent slumps, where the opportunity for hinge dislocation and rotation is more limited. Within coherent and semi-coherent slumps, folds are reworked to create classic Type 1, 2 and 3 refold patterns during a single progressive deformation perhaps lasting just a matter of minutes. It is noteworthy that slump folds are typically lacking in smaller parasitic folds, implying that instantaneous development and/or limited viscosity contrasts have hindered the formation of second order folds. As deformation intensifies within semi-coherent to incoherent slumps, some fold hinges rotate towards the flow direction to create sheath folds. However, many fold hinges do not rotate into the flow direction, but rather roll downslope to form a new category of spiral folds. Extreme deformation may also generate semi-detached fold trains in which the short limbs of verging fold pairs are relatively thickened resulting in en-echelon X folds. The hinges of the sheared fold pair are reduced to apophyses, although these can still be used to infer original fold vergence. As observations are from a thin slumped system over a relatively small area, the variation in structural style from coherent to incoherent is attributed to increasing deformation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the preliminary results regarding the lithostratigraphy, petrography and petrology of James Ross Island Volcanic Group dominating the Lachman Crags and Cape Lachman lava-fed deltas in the Ulu Peninsula, James Ross Island north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula. Studied lava-fed deltas were produced via Late Miocene to Pleistocene sub-marine and sub-glacial volcanism and made up four main lithofacies: a- bottomset pillow lavas, peperites and associated volcanoclastic/siliciclastic deposits; b- foreset-bedded hyaloclastite breccias; c- intrusions (feeder dykes, sills, and plugs) and d- topset subaerial lavas. Collectively these lithofacies record the transition from an effusive subaqueous to an effusive subaerial eruption environment. All lava samples and dykes from bottomset, foreset and topset lava-fed delta associations are olivine-phyric alkali basalts and are mineralogically and geochemically homogeneous. These eruptive products display significant enrichments in alkali contents and have ocean island basalt (OIB)-type, intra-plate geochemical signatures characterized by enrichments in all highly to moderately incompatible trace elements relative to basaltic rocks from ocean ridge settings. Volcanic products from a number of different eruptive periods display limited variations in major and trace element relative abundances, indicating derivation from a relatively homogeneous mantle source. The results of quantitative modelling of geochemical data is consistent with the view that the primary melts from which these mafic alkaline rocks were originated are the products of relatively small degrees (\textasciitilde 3-7\%) of partial melting of a volatile-bearing, metasomatized mantle source. The magmatism is likely the result of extension-driven mantle upwelling.},

  abstract = {The James Ross Island Volcanic Group (JRIVG) at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula is composed of various types of volcanic rocks erupted during the Late Miocene to Late Pleistocene. The sub-aerial lavas are the most abundant erupted products within the suite and are represented by alkali olivine basalts that contain significant amounts of ultramafic xenoliths. Precise determination of chemical compositions of olivine by electron microprobe and LA-ICP-MS reveals more than one compositionally distinct olivine population in the xenoliths and the host lavas. The majority of the olivine grains from the xenolith suite are remarkable for their high Mg/Fe ratios ({$>$}Fo88) and low-Ca contents ({$<$}500\,ppm) and are similar in composition to the mantle olivine, while some others, despite their similarly low-Ca abundances, are characterized by significantly lower Mg/Fe ({$<$}Fo85) reflecting some degree of differentiation. We interpret the co-existence of both olivine types with low-Ca contents as reflecting a magmatic cumulate origin of the xenoliths through olivine-dominated fractional crystallization from a H2O-rich parent magma, during which the presence of water affects the partitioning behavior of elements and reduces the DCaOolivine/melt significantly. The cores of the most primitive olivine macrocrysts ({$>$}Fo88) from the basaltic lavas also have low Ca contents compared to MORB olivine at similar Fo, indicating an arc-melt like volatile content of the primary magma. Evaluation of minor and trace element relative abundances in olivine further indicate that the alkaline basalts in the JRIVG are the products of peridotite-dominated partial melting of a volatile-rich mantle source with signatures of mantle hydration most probably promoted by preceding subduction events. The results from olivine chemistry, when combined with the evaluation of primary melt compositions, appear to be consistent with the view that the primary magmas from which the JRIVG basalts were derived are the results of partial melting of a mantle domain that has experienced hydrous silicate melt metasomatism through interaction of peridotitic upper mantle rocks with melts of a slab-derived component, most probably generated by dehydration melting of subducted oceanic crust.},

  abstract = {Glaciers create some of Earth’s steepest topography; yet, many areas that were repeatedly overridden by ice sheets in the last few million years include extensive plateaus. The distinct geomorphic contrast between plateaus and the glacial troughs that dissect them has sustained two long-held hypotheses: first, that ice sheets perform insignificant erosion beyond glacial troughs, and, second, that the plateaus represent ancient pre-glacial landforms bearing information of tectonic and geomorphic history prior to Pliocene–Pleistocene global cooling (\textasciitilde 3.5\,Myr ago). Here we show that the Fennoscandian ice sheets drove widespread erosion across plateaus far beyond glacial troughs. We apply inverse modelling to 118 new cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al measurements to quantify ice sheet erosion on the plateaus fringing the Sognefjorden glacial trough in western Norway. Our findings demonstrate substantial modification of the pre-glacial landscape during the Quaternary, and that glacial erosion of plateaus is important when estimating the global sediment flux to the oceans.},

The use of rupture and friction laws allows determination of the two remaining unknowns, that is, the reconstruction of the complete stress tensor. Taking into account the depth of overburden brings an additional constraint. The method is applied and discussed in the case of the Hoover Dam site (western U.S.A.), where large data sets and rock mechanics information are available. Differences between intact sample and rock mass properties account for apparent disagreements between paleostress levels determined in similar tectonic environments.

  abstract = {The Nussloch loess sequences were sampled at close intervals (10 cm) and documented in respect of their stratigraphy, palaeopedology, sedimentology, palynology, malacology and geochemistry, and were dated using radiocarbon and OSL methods. For each stratigraphic unit, the results of both the "eld studies and the analytical and geochronological data obtained cast light upon the response of the loessic environment to global climatic variations during the last cycle. The basal soil complex underwent a pedosedimentary evolution similar to those of the bordering area (complex Luvisol/Greyzem/`steppe soila) which re\#ects the classic progression towards increased continentality of the environment between the end of the Eemian (5d) and the beginning of the full glacial stage (Pleniglacial). The Lower Pleniglacial corresponds to an initially very arid phase dominated by the accumulation of loess, followed by the deposition of strati"ed niveo-eolian sands. The Middle Pleniglacial complex (ca. 55\vphantom\{\}30) is clearly characterised by the inhibited loessic sedimentation. It is primarily marked by two phases of stabilisation recorded in the form of weathered horizons (Cambisols) which are separated by a rather thin layer corresponding to loessic sedimentation with tundra gleys. This intermediate phase brings together organic silt deposits which record an interstadial dated at 32\vphantom\{\}33 ka   C BP. The thick loessic accumulations of the Upper Pleniglacial ('10 m), which clearly began to accumulate before the oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 3/2 boundary, show evidence of vulnerability to considerable \#uctuations in response to variations in wind dynamics and the intensity of de\#ation in the Rhine valley. Finally, a proposed correlation of loess\vphantom\{\}palaeosol stratigraphies from Germany, Belgium and France, spanning the entire last interglacial\vphantom\{\}glacial cycle, is presented. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

  abstract = {A high resolution Digital Elevation Model with a ground resolution of 2 m×2 m (DEM2) was obtained for the Collazzone area, central Umbria, through weighted linear interpolation of elevation points acquired by Airborne Lidar Swath Mapping. Acquisition of the elevation data was performed on 3 May 2004, following a rainfall period that resulted in numerous landslides. A reconnaissance field survey conducted immediately after the rainfall period allowed mapping 70 landslides in the study area, for a total landslide area of 2.7×105 m2. Topographic derivative maps obtained from the DEM2 were used to update the reconnaissance landslide inventory map in 22 selected sub-areas. The revised inventory map shows 27\% more landslides and 39\% less total landslide area, corresponding to a smaller average landslide size. Discrepancies between the reconnaissance and the revised inventory maps were attributed to mapping errors and imprecision chiefly in the reconnaissance field inventory. Landslides identified exploiting the Lidar elevation data matched the local topography more accurately than the same landslides mapped using the existing topographic maps. Reasons for the difference include an incomplete or inaccurate view of the landslides in the field, an unfaithful representation of topography in the based maps, and the limited time available to map the landslides in the field. The high resolution DEM2 was compared to a coarser resolution (10 m×10 m) DEM10 to establish how well the two DEMs captured the topographic signature of landslides. Results indicate that the improved topographic information provided by DEM2 was significant in identifying recent rainfallinduced landslides, and was less significant in improving the representation of stable slopes.},

A set of thematic maps were produced, based on existing geological maps and freely-available ASTER Global DEM elevation data, using various geological information (i.e. lineaments and lithologies), geomorphometric indices (i.e. slope gradient, drainage density, stream frequency, and the topographic wetness index) and morphotectonic indices (i.e. amplitude of relief and stream length gradient) that highlight areas of neotectonic landscape deformation. The weights of the factors were determined using AHP and WLC. A neotectonic landscape deformation index (NLDI) is computed as the sum of the various weighted factors to provide a map of NLDI distribution across the study region (western Crete). The main objective of this study was to analyse and map the intra-basin spatial variations in neotectonic landscape deformation: five classes, very low to very high, were determined. High to very high deformation zones are linked with known and newly detected active fault zones. The methodology could be developed into a low-cost technique for assessing seismic hazard, guiding disaster risk reduction activities. It can provide an alternative to the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) approach for highlighting zones of neotectonic deformation, particularly in regions where dense vegetation or snow cover renders InSAR ineffective.},

  abstract = {We summarize evidence for Quaternary and active faulting collected in the field during three Sino-French expeditions to southeastern Tibet (1980–1982). Detailed mapping of Quaternary and active faults as well as microtectonic measurements indicate that normal faulting has been the dominant tectonic regime north of the Himalayas in the last 2 ± 0.5 m.y. The maximum horizontal principal stress in south Tibet appears to be only the intermediate principal stress σ2, σ1 being vertical. South of the “chord” joining the eastern and western syntaxes of the Himalayan arc, extensional strains are principally localized within seven regularly spaced rift zones, three of which have been studied in some detail. The extension direction is determined to be N96° E ± 7° mainly from statistical averaging of strikes of newly formed normal faults. Throw rates on normal faults are evaluated for different time spans (2 ± 0.5 m.y., 60 ± 40 kyr, and 10 ± 2 kyr B.P.), using structural and topographic reliefs, as well as synglacial and postglacial vertical offsets. The rate of Quaternary extension is about 1\% m.y.−1 along an 1100-km-long ESE traverse across south Tibet. This corresponds to a “spreading” rate of 1 ± 0.6 cm/yr. This rate and the divergent horizontal projections of slip vectors of earthquakes along the Himalayan front constrain the rate at which rigid India underthrusts southern Tibet to be 2 ± 1 cm/yr. Although most of the normal faults appear to be independent of, and nearly orthogonal to, the ≃E-W Mesozoic-Tertiary tectonic fabric, the Yadong-Gulu rift appears to be guided for over 130 km by the older, oblique (≃NE-SW) Nyainqentanglha range and fault zones along it. This reactivated zone is the most prominent left-lateral strike-slip fault system in SE Tibet. Excepting this zone, and the vicinity of the SE extremity of the Karakorum fault, Quaternary strike-slip faulting is rare in south Tibet, i.e., south of the chord between the syntaxes of the Himalayan arc. North of the chord, the tectonic style is different. There minor conjugate strike-slip faulting is widespread and appears to control Quaternary normal faulting, which is more diffuse and subdued than in south Tibet. Along the chord, the presence of a major zone of active right-lateral, en échelon strike-slip faults (Karakorum-Jiali fault zone) probably reflects the greater facility of eastward extrusion in north central Tibet, in response to the northward push of India. The eastern Himalayan syntaxis may be an obstacle to such extrusion movements south of the chord.},

In this research, the lamped-mass analysis method was used and coefficients of restitution were calculated using the kinematic definitions. The laboratory testing was performed using a number of common rocks found in Greece. The rock materials tested were characterized by different Schmidt hammer rebound hardness values while the mass of the falling blocks as well as the impact angle and the velocity were altered during the tests in order to estimate the effect of each parameter on the coefficients of restitution. The kinematic coefficient of restitution was compared to the normal coefficient of restitution and was found to be more appropriate when used in correlations. Impact angle was found to significantly affect the trajectory. Finally, a correlation between Schmidt hammer rebound hardness and kinematic coefficient of restitution is proposed whilst a method for estimating the normal coefficient of restitution is suggested including the impacts’ angle effect.},

The upper part of the slope affected by the landslide is largely controlled by strata attitude while its basal part is marked by a strike–slip fault causing the tectonic juxtaposition of the carbonate successions against predominantly clayey flysch units. An integrated study, including geological, geomorphological and geotechnical investigations, was carried out to determine the features of the landslide and to plan further investigation and monitoring. In particular, from 2002 to 2004, Differential Global Positioning System monitoring and core drillings, coupled with inclinometer measurements, were carried out to determine the landslide’s kinematics, extent, depth to the surface of rupture and rates of movement. Inclinometer data revealed the presence of the rupture surface at a depth of about 20m. DGPS monitoring allowed rates of movement up to several tens of centimetres per year to be recorded. The nearby village of Civitanova del Sannio can still be considered at risk due to the landslide, as recent remedial works, consisting mainly of very shallow re-shaping of the slope by blasting and partial filling of trenches, did not succeed in stopping its movement.},

  abstract = {The evolution of the glacial valley cross-profile form is commonly attributed primarily to the glaciological variables that control the erosion of the channel. However, studies in the New Zealand Southern Alps suggest that the rock mass strength (RMS) of the eroded rock mass is a major control on slope stability, and hence on the final form of the trough. RMS of the slope rock will alter with time and erosional excavation and oversteepening of the valley slopes. The in situ rock stress field induced by: ( 1) the extreme topography in the axial ranges of the New Zealand Southern Alps, and (2) tectonically by collision of the Australian and Pacific crustal plates, may play a role in valley slope development by controlling the location of rock failure and reducing Rh4S. This provides weakened rock that may provide sites for selective glacial erosion of the rock mass. Hence, valley form evolution models should also take into account the RMS and the in situ stress field acting in the eroded rock mass. This study has implications for the development and modification of alpine glacial troughs in similar tectonic settings elsewhere.},

  abstract = {The interplay of processes acting over long to short time scales, which drive mountain building and erosion, condition the occurrence of rockslides. Due to the active geodynamic setting in the Central Andes and its southern limit towards the Patagonian Andes (24°S–38°S), large rockslides are wide spread; south of 38°S their occurrence decreases significantly. The aim of this work is to review the distribution and forcing factors of those large scale slope failures, which are mostly located in three regions. 1) Between 24°–27°30’S: large slope failures were observed on deeply incised narrow valleys and steep fault-bounded mountain fronts. Rockslides volumes reach 0.44 km3. They involved granites, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Quaternary tectonic activity along reverse faults has played a major role in the development of these slope collapses. 2) Between 30°–33°S, 38 rockslides with volumes up to 1.6 km3 are observed. Failure occurred both in glacial and fluvial valleys, as well as in mountain fronts. Most of the rockslides developed along or within 1 km of main tectonic structures. Some of which were related to post-glacial climatic conditions. 3) Between 36°–38°S, corresponding to the transition between the Central and Patagonian Andes, \^45 rockslides developed in glacial and fluvial valleys. Neotectonic activity was proposed here as being responsible for the generation of rockslides with volumes up to 4 s 109 m3. Large scale rockslides in the Argentinean Andes tend to occur in zones where the combination of tectonic deformation (past and quaternary), relief and seismicity results in favorable conditions for failure.},

  abstract = {The Schmidt hammer provides a quick and inexpensive measure of surface hardness that is widely used for estimating the mechanical properties of rock material. However, a number of issues such as hammer type, normalization of rebound values, specimen dimensions, surface smoothness, weathering and moisture content, and testing, data reduction and analysis procedures continue to influence the consistency and reliability of the Schmidt hammer test results. This paper presents: a) a critical review of these basic issues; and b) the results of tests conducted on granitic rocks of various weathering grades in the light of the conclusions of this review. It was found that a very good correlation exists between L and N hammer rebound values and that both hammers are fairly sensitive to the physical properties, particularly to dry density though less so to effective and total porosities. The N hammer, producing a lesser scatter in the data, proved to be more efficient than the L hammer in predicting uniaxial compressive strength and Young’s modulus. The exponential form of the correlation curves was found to reflect microstructural changes during the course of weathering and the differences in the probing scales or mechanisms in the means of measuring these mechanical properties, and could be generalized to other crystalline igneous rocks. The possibility of predicting weathering grades from rebound values was also explored. The changes in the rebound values during multiple impacts at a given point produced a better indication of the weathering grade than a single impact value. It was concluded that increasing the impact energy and plunger tip diameter should significantly reduce the scatter in coarse-grained weathered rocks and hence improve the reliability of the Schmidt hammer as a rock material characterization tool.},

The walls of several paleochannels, downcut into sensitive marine clayey silts, are scarred by numerous large earthflows of sizes unequaled in historical time. While radiocarbon ages of 15 landslides, as much as 35 km apart, range from ca, 1870 to 5130 yr B.P., the majority of events cluster at ca. 4550 yr B.P. The coincidence of numerous large failures in different paleovalleys, occurring concurrently, long after channel abandonment and at a time of drier climate, suggests that the widespread landsliding was triggered by a strong earthquake. Close to the landslide area, areas of very disturbed terrain in a flat erosional plain show severely deformed bedding and irregular ground subsidence and are attributed to a large earthquake, ca, 7060 yr B.P., that strongly shook a thick sequence of sensitive material filling deep, steep-sided, bedrock basins.},

  abstract = {Complex landslides in clay-bearing sediments are investigated in two moderate-relief regions of Southeast Spain. Both regions, more than 100. km apart show landslides affecting the same Flysch formation, which outcrops widely in the central and western Betic Cordillera along the contact between the External (South Iberian Domain) and Internal (Alborán Domain) zones. Intense rainfall episodes can be considered as the main triggering factor for slope failures in these two areas. We have chosen two landslides (Diezma and Riogordo landslides), one from each area of study, to investigate their morphological and geotechnical features in order to establish the relative importance of the different controlling factors. From a kinematic point of view, the two features studied in detail can be referred as to rotational failures, evolving downhill to slow earthflows. The movement was concentrated on several surfaces developed on a clay-rich layer mostly constituted by smectite. This clay mineral is of critical relevance to the mechanical behaviour of soils and Flysch-like formations, being very consistent at dry conditions, but rapidly losing its strength at wet conditions. Thus, softened smectite-rich clay layers with high water contents can approach the properties of a lubricant, which, in turn, can be critical for slope stability. In addition to their high plasticity, these clays have a high swelling potential, which can induce significant vertical overpressure, thus reducing even more the strength properties of the Flysch formation. In Southeast Spain, a region with a Mediterranean rainfall regime, slope stability can be seriously influenced by the presence of these smectite-rich clay layers in a formation of regional extent, as is the case of the Flysch formation. Therefore, this lithologically-controlled factor should be taken into account when evaluating landslide hazard in the Betic Cordillera. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

The slide, which took place after a period of heavy rainfall, involved a slope made up of 34 million cubic meters of fractured igneous rock. The rock mass detached between the elevations of 2250 and 1700 m above s.1. and, with the characteristics of a rock avalanche, fell approximately 800 m, devastating the bottom of the valley over a distance of 4 km and killing 27 people. The mass movement was due to the reactivation of a paleoslide, triggered by the rise of hydrostatic pressure in the fractured rock mass and by deep erosion along the bed of Pola creek.},

  abstract = {Both 3-D physical modeling and 2-D numerical modeling were used to analyze the development of DeepSeated Gravitational Slope Deformations. We focused especially on the link between fracturing and morphological features such as Sagging/Sackung. Physical modeling was performed by using properly scaled analogue materials as well as an original vertical accelerator device. This device enables cyclic loading of the model, and to advance step by step in the deformation process. This technique is thus particularly well suited to analyze rupture initiation and evolution. Surface deformation is registered with a high resolution digital camera. Internal model deformation was studied by making cross-sections at different experiment stages. The failure of one or both mountain sides was observed, with a deep-seated failure zone that follows an almost circular trajectory. It intersects the surface perpendicularly in the upper part. Other fractures are generated in the moving mass in response to its motion. Fracture network becomes wider and morphological features such as counterscarps are generated. Numerical models were performed with a 2-D finite element code named Adeli. We tried to reproduce physical modeling results by using the same mechanical behaviour and parameters of the analogue material. The results reproduced failure initiation well, but poorly described moving mass deformation. Furthermore rupture initiation in the 2-D numerical models occurs more easily (e.g. for a lower acceleration value) than in the 3-D physical models, confirming the importance of the three dimensional analysis.},

  abstract = {In north-west Scotland, mountain-top detritus forms blockfields or diamicts, depending on lithology. Clast angularity, absence of grussification and transition to underlying rock imply formation by frost-wedging of bedrock. Age is constrained by trimlines and exposure dating of weathering zones. Mountain-top detritus is ubiquitous on nunataks that remained above the level of the last ice sheet, but occurs only on well-jointed rocks in areas exposed to periglacial conditions since ice-sheet downwastage and is absent from areas exposed to weathering only during the Holocene. Most secondary clay minerals are equally represented both above and below a trimline cut by the last ice sheet, indicating formation since deglaciation, though haematite and gibbsite are preferentially represented on former nunataks. The age and significance of mountain-top detritus are determined by lithology and glacial history. On well-jointed rocks, such detritus has developed within a few millennia of exposure to periglacial conditions. On massive lithologies, however, it has formed over much longer timescales on nunataks above the last and possibly earlier ice sheets. In north-east Scotland ancient (possibly pre-Pleistocene) regolith also appears to have survived under a cover of cold-based ice. Use of the distribution of mountain-top detritus in palaeoglaciological reconstructions therefore requires caution. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Major postglacial rock slope failures are a common feature of the Scottish Highlands and other mountainous areas that were deglaciated at the end of the Pleistocene, but evaluation of the causes and triggers of failure has been hindered by a lack of reliable dating evidence. We report the result of a pilot study designed to establish the absolute age of a large postglacial rotational rockslide at The Storr on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, using 36Cl surface exposure dating. Exposure ages of 6.3 ± 0.7 cal. ka BP and 6.6 ± 0.8 cal. ka BP were obtained for rock samples from two separate landslide blocks, giving an overall age estimate of 6.5 ± 0.5 cal. ka BP for rock slope failure at this site. This date is consistent with AMS radiocarbon dating of windblown sand derived from the failure scarp, and with previous inferences (based on relative dating evidence) concerning an early-Holocene age for most rock slope failures in the Scottish Highlands. The long time lag (Ͼ 7 ka) between deglaciation and failure suggests that progressive joint extension and shearing of rock bridges and asperities were of critical importance in conditioning failure, though a seismic trigger cannot be ruled out. The methodology of surface exposure dating in this context is described and its future potential assessed.},

  abstract = {The temporal pattern of rock-slope failures (RSFs) following Late Pleistocene deglaciation on tectonically stable terrains is controversial: previous studies variously suggest (1) a rapid response due to removal of supporting ice (‘debuttressing’), (2) a progressive decline in RSF frequency, and (3) a millennial-scale delay before peak RSF activity. We test these competing models through beryllium-10 (10Be) exposure dating of five closely-spaced quartzite RSFs on the Isle of Jura, Scotland, to establish the relationship between timing of failure and those of deglaciation, episodes of rapid warming and periods of rapid glacio-isostatic uplift. All five dated RSFs occurred at least 720–2240 years after deglaciation, with the probability of failure peaking \textasciitilde 2 ka after deglaciation, consistent with millennial-scale delay model (3). This excludes debuttressing as an immediate cause of failure, though it is likely that time-dependent stress release due to deglacial unloading resulted in progressive development of failure planes within the rock. Thaw of permafrost ice in joints is unlikely to have been a prime trigger of failure as some RSFs occurred several centuries after the onset of interstadial warming. Conversely, the timespan of the RSFs coincides with the period of maximum glacio-isostatic crustal uplift, suggesting that failure was triggered by uplift-driven seismic events acting on fractured rock masses. Implications of this and related research are: (1) that retreat of the last Pleistocene ice sheets across tectonically-stable mountainous terrains was succeeded by a period of enhanced rock-slope failure due to deglacial unloading and probably uplift-driven seismicity; (2) that the great majority of RSFs in the British Isles outside the limits of Loch Lomond Stadial (= Younger Dryas) glaciation are of Lateglacial (pre-Holocene) age; and (3) numerous RSFs must also have occurred inside Loch Lomond Stadial (LLS) glacial limits, but that runout debris was removed by LLS glaciers.

  abstract = {Relict rock glaciers have considerable potential for contributing to palaeoclimatic reconstruction, but this potential is often undermined by lack of dating control and problems of interpretation. Here we reinvestigate and date four proposed ‘rock glaciers’ in the Cairngorm Mountains and show that the morphology of only one of these appears consistent with that of a true rock glacier produced by creep of underlying ice or ice-rich sediment. All four features comprise rockslide or rock avalanche runout debris, and the possibility that all four represent unmodified runout accumulations cannot be discounted. Surface exposure dating of the four debris accumulations using cosmogenic 10Be produced uncertainty-weighted mean ages of 15.4 Æ 0.8 ka, 16.2 Æ 1.0 ka, 12.1 Æ 0.6 ka and 12.7 Æ 0.8 ka. All four ages imply emplacement under cold stadial conditions, two prior to the Windermere Interstade of ca. 14.5–12.9 cal. ka BP and two during the Loch Lomond Stade of ca. 12.9–11.5 cal. ka BP. The above ages indicate that paraglacial rock-slope failure on granite rockwalls occurred within a few millennia after deglaciation. The mean exposure ages obtained for runout debris at two sites – Strath Nethy (16.2 Æ 1.0 ka) and Lairig Ghru (15.4 Æ 0.8 ka) – are consistent with basal radiocarbon ages from Loch Etteridge, 22 km to the southwest (mean ¼ 15.6 Æ 0.3 cal. ka BP) and imply widespread deglaciation of the Cairngorms and adjacent valleys before 15 ka and possibly 16 ka.

  abstract = {A rich variety of processes have modified the glacial landscape of the Scottish Highlands since the last glaciers disappeared 11,500 years ago. Many of these processes can be described as paraglacial (glacially-conditioned): retreat of glacier ice has resulted in exposure of metastable sediment sources (rock slopes, drift-mantled slopes and valley-floor glacigenic deposits) that have been reworked over a range of timescales. Much of the reworked sediment has been deposited in paraglacial sediment stores (talus accumulations, debris cones, alluvial fans, valley fills, river terraces and deltas). The trajectory of paraglacial sediment transfer can be approximated by an exhaustion model. A corollary of this model is that all sediment stores eventually undergo a change from net accumulation to net erosion, reflecting the non-renewable nature of sediment sources. This concept helps to explain why most talus accumulations, debris cones and alluvial fans in the Highlands are now relict, and why many floodplains appear to have experienced an initial period of aggradation followed by later river incision and terrace development. Since deglaciation, rock slopes have experienced paraglacial stress release due to differential deglacial unloading. Many rock slopes have remained stable or experienced gradual adjustment through intermittent rockfall. At over 600 sites, however, large-scale rock-slope failure has occurred, either in the form of catastrophic failure with complete or arrested debris runout, or as major slope deformations. Modification of drift-mantled slopes has been dominated by rainstorm-generated debris flows activity, which have stripped sediment from slopes and redeposited it in debris cones. Radiocarbon dating of buried organic horizons shows that debris flows have occurred intermittently throughout the Holocene. Snow avalanches have played only a localized role in paraglacial sediment transfer. The Holocene alluvial history of the Highlands is poorly understood. Some alluvial fans formed during a few exceptional flood events, and there is evidence that postglacial floodplain aggradation peaked in the late Holocene and was succeeded by floodplain incision and terrace development, possibly reflecting upstream reduction in paraglacial sediment supply. Other processes have operated independently of glacial conditioning. The effects of wind action are dominant in the coastal zone, forming dunefields through aeolian reworking of beach sand, and on plateaux in the form of deflation surfaces and sand sheets. Extensive erosion of plateau-top sands and aeolisols occurred in the period AD 1550–1700, a period of exceptional storminess. Small-scale periglacial processes have also been active on high ground throughout the Holocene, including granular weathering of exposed rock surfaces, the development of small-scale frost-sorted patterned ground on unvegetated terrain, and slow downslope movement of solifluction sheets, solifluction lobes and ploughing boulders.},

  abstract = {Nine postglacial quartzite rock slope failures (RSFs) in north-west Ireland were dated using cosmogenic 10Be. Weighted mean RSF ages range from 17.7 Æ 0.9 to 12.5 Æ 0.7 ka or 16.6 Æ 0.7 to 11.7 Æ 0.5 ka, depending on assumed 10Be production rate. All dated RSFs occurred within \$5000 years following ice-sheet deglaciation at \$17.4ka (\$16.3 ka) and all but two occurred within 2000 years after deglaciation. The timing of RSFs rules out glacial ‘debuttressing’, permafrost degradation and enhanced deglacial cleft-water pressures as triggers of failure in most cases. We infer that paraglacial stress release and associated fracture propagation were critical in reducing rock masses to critical stability, although earthquakes caused by Lateglacial glacio-isostatic rebound and/or release of stored tectonic stresses may have triggered failure in some or all cases. In conjunction with data from related studies, our results imply that most undated RSFs outside the limit of Younger Dryas glaciation in the British Isles are of Lateglacial age, and that numerous Lateglacial RSFs occurred inside these limits, with subsequent removal of debris by glaciers. They support the view that paraglacial RSF activity in tectonically stable intraplate terrains was concentrated within a few millennia following deglaciation.},

  abstract = {Many formerly-glaciated mountains exhibit a high density of postglacial rock-slope failures (RSFs) in the form of rockslides, rock avalanches or deep-seated gravitational slope deformations. Such RSFs are often termed ‘paraglacial’ as they reflect pre-conditioning by glaciation and deglaciation. The temporal pattern of paraglacial RSFs is unknown. We employ 47 cosmogenic isotope exposure ages obtained for 17 catastrophic RSFs in the Scottish Highlands to test models of changes in RSF frequency since deglaciation. Our results show that RSF activity spans almost the entire postglacial period from \textasciitilde 17 ka until \textasciitilde 1.5 ka, and that the periodicity of sampled postglacial RSFs is statistically indistinguishable from a pattern of uniform periodicity (\textasciitilde 1 ka−1). Our data do not conform to proposed models of declining RSF frequency with time elapsed since deglaciation, but suggest that the temporal distribution of postglacial RSFs is best described by a combination of rapid response (enhanced RSF frequency during or immediately after deglaciation) followed by approximately constant periodicity. Our findings are consistent with near-surface fracturing of rock when glacially-induced confining stresses are removed, causing some failures during or immediately after deglaciation and reducing other slopes to critical conditional stability so that failure is triggered by progressive rock-mass weakening or by transient triggering mechanisms. Neither permafrost degradation (thaw of ice in joints) nor seismic activity offers a general explanation for triggering Scottish RSFs, but could be contributory in some cases. The quasi-constant periodicity inferred for Holocene RSFs implies that the probability of RSFs in this seismically-quiescent intraplate area has not changed in the past \textasciitilde 10 ka, and that further (though infrequent) catastrophic RSFs are likely to occur in the future.},

  abstract = {The combination of analytical and analogue models gives new opportunities to better understand the kinematic parameters controlling the evolution of transpression zones. In this work, we carried out a set of analogue models using the kinematic parameters of transpressional deformation obtained by applying a general triclinic transpression analytical model to a tabular-shaped shear zone in the external Betic Chain (Torcal de Antequera massif). According to the results of the analytical model, we used two oblique convergence angles to reproduce the main structural and kinematic features of structural domains observed within the Torcal de Antequera massif (α = 15° for the outer domains and α = 30° for the inner domain). Two parallel inclined backstops (one fixed and the other mobile) reproduce the geometry of the shear zone walls of the natural case. Additionally, we applied digital particle image velocimetry (PIV) method to calculate the velocity field of the incremental deformation. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of the main structures observed in the Torcal de Antequera massif reflects different modes of strain partitioning and strain localization between two domain types, which are related to the variation in the oblique convergence angle and the presence of steep planar velocity – and rheological – discontinuities (the shear zone walls in the natural case). In the 15° model, strain partitioning is simple and strain localization is high: a single narrow shear zone is developed close and parallel to the fixed backstop, bounded by strike-slip faults and internally deformed by R and P shears. In the 30° model, strain partitioning is strong, generating regularly spaced oblique-to-the backstops thrusts and strikeslip faults. At final stages of the 30° experiment, deformation affects the entire model box. Our results show that the application of analytical modelling to natural transpressive zones related to upper crustal deformation facilitates to constrain the geometrical parameters of analogue models.},

The method is restricted to cold seasons, and its utility is demonstrated through three examples from the Flysch Belt of the Outer West Carpathians (rockslides at Kopce Hill and Mt. Kněhyně) and from the Northern Calcareous Alps (deepseated gravitational slope deformations in Gschliefgraben/Mt. Traunstein). The approach is based on a contrast between temperatures deep within the rock mass, which at a depth of few meters represent local mean annual values, and winter-time temperatures of the ground surface. In winter, warmer, buoyant air from depth rises to the ground surface through open cracks and joints, and the temperature contrast can be detected by IRT. Our test survey was conducted in the beginning of February 2012, in order to achieve the best contrast between temperatures around open tension cracks and the adjacent ground. For temperature sensing, we used a FLIR B360 thermal camera; for airborne surveys in the ambient air, temperatures at the time of our surveys ranged from approximately −19 to −7°C. IRT results conclusively revealed the presence of open cracks, loosened rock zones, and pseudo-karst caves over a distance sometimes greater than 1km. The IRT approach proved useful for rapidly assessing the distribution of open cracks and tension fractures, key information required for assessing rockfall and rockslide hazard.},

We document here a case of river piracy from the upper part of the Malá Brodská Valley in the Vsetínské Mts., Czech Republic (Rača Unit of the flysch Magura Group of Nappes, flysch belt of the Outer Western Carpathians) controlled by mass movement processes. Based on the field geological, geomorphological and geophysical data, we found out that the landslide accumulations pushed the more active river of out of two subparallel river channels with different erosion activity westwards and forced intensive lateral erosion towards the recently abandoned valley. Apart from the landslide processes, the presence of the N-striking fault, accentuated by higher flow rates of the eastern channel as a result of its larger catchment area, were the most critical factors of the river piracy. As a consequence of the river piracy, intensive retrograde erosion in the elbow of capture and also within the upper portion of the western catchment occurred. Deposits of two landslide dams document recent minimum erosion rates to be 18.8 mm.ky−1 in the western (captured) catchment, and 3.6 mm.ky−1 in the eastern catchment respectively. The maximum age of the river piracy is estimated to be of the late Glacial and/or the early Holocene.},

  abstract = {Deglaciated areas in the valleys of the Italian Alps have recently exhibited a high potential for geomorphologic hazards from diffuse deep-seated gravitational deformations (DSGSDs), caused by rock-mass creep processes that can evolve into rock falls and rock avalanches. A multidisciplinary approach that integrated geomorphologic surveys and stress–strain numerical simulations was used to investigate the effects of the stress release that was induced by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Adamè Valley (Italian Alps). No evidence of DSGSDs has been found in this area; however, data are available to develop a well-constrained evolutionary model of the valley deglaciation. The extent and thickness of the southern extension of the Adamello glacier (the widest glacier in Italy) during its primary growth phases, including those of the LGM, three Late Glacial stages and the Little Ice Age (LIA) were reconstructed using glacial geological surveys and were reproduced using a finite-difference stress–strain sequential model spanning from the LGM to the present. A thermomechanical numerical configuration was developed based on geomechanical field measurements that were collected from rock outcrops and data from laboratory tests, specifically performed on intact rock samples. The numerical simulations demonstrate that thermomechanical viscous behaviour cannot be neglected because the resulting strains on the slopes are significantly higher than those resulting from conventional elastoplastic behaviour. The last major thermal effect in the rock masses reproduced using the model occurred from 11.5ka until the LIA; the resulting displacement rates are as much as several tens of mm/ka, which are consistent with the absence of DSGSDs in the Adamè Valley, as these rates are significantly lower than those previously obtained from DSGSDs and other large landslides in the Alps. Based on thermomechanical numerical solutions, these rates should persist for the next 1000years assuming that no variations in current climatic conditions occur.},

Since they represent very complicated system, understanding of their evolution and triggers still remains unclear. We tried to provide a back-analysis of their development by using a finite difference code (FDM) of continua (Flac 4.0). We confirmed that such large mass movements could be triggered by water saturation of the bedrock in the three particular geological and geomorphic settings. Such situation could have been caused by heavy rainfalls in humid phases of the Holocene or permafrost melting in Late Glacial. The effects of faulting, very deep weathering of the bedrock, low geotechnical parameters of smectite-rich material and the local slope geometry have also been accounted for in numerical models, as well as the other triggering factors of slope instability.

  abstract = {For better understanding of the dynamics of large slope failures, the slope-scale stress field reconstructions are eligible. A new approach of paleostress analysis of large gravitational mass movements, based on the multiple inverse method in 9D space and processed by a non-commercial code MARK2010, is demonstrated on the case of a gigantic gravitational slope failure in active tectonic setting at Mount Qoshadagh in NW Iran. The entire slope failure represents a very deep-seated gravitational slope deformation with relatively short displacement, roto-translational base and an estimated volume of about 83–110 km3 which is of the last glacial age. This gigantic slope failure has developed in an active-tectonic setting along the Qoshadagh Fault System (or called South Ahar Fault), which caused fast uplift of the entire mountain range of Qoshadagh, and it was probably seismically triggered. Using this paleostress approach, we were able to distinguish the mass-movement stress phase of NW compression in the rockslide's zone of compression and NW–SE extension in the upper part from a variety of other 8 regional-tectonic and 2 subsequent gravitational phases. Maximum principal stress of the slope-failure phase was in its compression zone sub-parallel to the estimated displacement vector; in the head it was sub-vertical. The paleostress analysis has been proved as a useful tool for reconstructing the stress field evolution of large slope failures.},

These mass movements result in a large spectrum of slope failures, depending on the type of movement and the nature of the bedrock. This paper presents the results of a detailed survey and reconstruction of three distinct deep-seated slope failures in the Raca Unit of the Magura Nappe, Flysch Belt of the Western Carpathians in the Czech Republic. An interdisciplinary approach has enabled a global view of the dynamics and development of these deep-seated slope failures. The three cases considered here have revealed a complex, polyphase development of slope failure. They are deep-seated ones with depths to the failure surface ranging from 50 to 110 m. They differ in mechanism of movement, failure structure, current activity, and total displacement. The main factors influencing their development have been flysch-bedrock structure, lithology, faulting by bedrock separation (which enabled further weakening through deep weathering), geomorphic setting, swelling of smectite-rich clays, and finally heavy rainfall. All of the slope failures considered here seem to have originated during humid phases of the Holocene or during the Late Glacial.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic deep-seated rock slope failures (RSFs; e.g., rock avalanches) can be particularly useful proxies for fault rupture and strong ground motion, and currently represent an underappreciated hazard of earthquakes in New Zealand. This study presents observations of the previously undescribed Cascade rock avalanche (CRA), a c. 0.75 km3 single-event, long-runout, catastrophic failure interpreted to have been coseismically triggered by a large to great earthquake c. 660 AD on the Alpine Fault. Despite its size and remarkable preservation, the CRA deposit has been previously identified as a terminal moraine and fault-damaged outcrop, highlighting the common misinterpretation of similar rock avalanche deposits. Comparisons are drawn between the CRA and other Alpine Faultattributed rock avalanches, such as the better-studied c. 860 AD Round Top rock avalanche, to re-assess coseismic rock avalanche hazard. Structural relationships indicate the rock mass comprising the CRA may have formerly been a portion of a larger (c. 3 km3) RSF, before its catastrophic collapse on a deep-seated gravitational collapse structure (sackung). Sackungen and RSFs are common throughout the Southern Alps and other mountainous regions worldwide; in many cases, they should be considered potential precursors to catastrophic failure events. Two masses of rock in the Cascade River Valley show precursory signs of potential catastrophic failures of up to c. 2 km3; a similar mass may threaten the town of Franz Josef.},

  abstract = {We combine recently acquired airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data along a portion of the Alpine fault with previous work to define the ways in which the plate-boundary structures partition at three different scales from {$<$}106 to 100 m. At the first order ({$<$}106–104 m), the Alpine fault is a remarkably straight and unpartitioned structure controlled by inherited and active weakening processes at depth. At the second order (104–103 m), motion is serially partitioned in the upper \textasciitilde 1–2 km onto oblique-thrust and strike-slip fault segments that arise at the scale of major river valleys due to stress perturbations from hanging-wall topographic variations and river incision destabilization of the hanging-wall critical wedge, concepts proposed by previous workers. The resolution of the LiDAR data refines second-order mapping and reveals for the first time that at a third order (103–100 m), the fault is parallel-partitioned into asymmetric positive flower structures, or fault wedges, in the hanging wall. These fault wedges are bounded by dextral-normal and dextral-thrust faults rooted at shallow depths ({$<$}600 m) on a planar, moderately southeast-dipping, dextral-reverse fault plane.The fault wedges have widths of \textasciitilde 300 m and are bounded by and contain kinematically stable fault traces that define a surface-rupture hazard zone. Newly discovered anticlinal ridges between fault traces indicate that a component of shallow shortening within the fault wedge is accommodated through folding. A fault kinematic analysis predicts the fault trace orientations observed and indicates that third-order fault trace locations and kinematics arise independently of topographic controls. We constructed a slip stability analysis that suggests the new strike-slip faults will easily accommodate displacement within the hanging-wall wedge, and that thrust motion is most easily accommodated on faults oblique to the overall strike of the Alpine fault. We suggest that the thickness of footwall sediments and width of the fault damage zone (i.e., presence of weaker, more isotropic materials) are major factors in defining the width, extent, and geometry of third-order near-surface fault wedges.},

  abstract = {Existing techniques of rock-joint modelling are reviewed. It is concluded that no methods presently in use are acceptable as either realistic models of mating rock joints or as mass production methods for the development of large, highly jointed models of rock masses. A method is described for producing mating tension fractures in a weak, brittle model material using a large guillotine device. Parallel sets of model joints can be produced which are continuous, cross-jointed or offset (stepped) depending upon the chronological order of fracturing. The direct shear properties of these three types are compared and evaluated. The model results are used as a basis for predicting the full-scale (1: 500) displacements accompanying shear failure of a 96-ft long prototype tension joint. Recent numerical modelling of jointed rock masses has been based on assumed values of the shear and normal stiffness of the joints. These components are found to dominate the elastic deformation properties of the intact rock. The results of shear and normal stiffness tests on the model joints are used for a careful assessment of these quantities. The shear stiffness (peak shear stress per unit tangential displacement) is found to be both normal stress and size dependent, and this is confirmed by a survey of shear-test data for joints in rock. There appears to be an inverse proportionality between test dimension and shear stiffness, for a given normal stress. The normal stiffness (normal stress per unit closure) is found to be dependent on the preconsolidation or virgin normal stress level. The problems of simulating the behaviour of jointed rock masses by the finite-element method are reviewed. Two particular drawbacks seem to be the conservation of energy demanded during computation, and the computer storage problems involved in modelling dilatent joints. Both these features are of fundamental importance to rock-mass deformation. A move towards realistic physical modelling is considered essential to an understanding of real processes.},

  abstract = {Although many intact rock types can be very strong, a critical confining pressure can eventually be reached in triaxial testing, such that the Mohr shear strength envelope becomes horizontal. This critical state has recently been better defined, and correct curvature or correct deviation from linear Mohr–Coulomb (M-C) has finally been found. Standard shear testing procedures for rock joints, using multiple testing of the same sample, in case of insufficient samples, can be shown to exaggerate apparent cohesion. Even rough joints do not have any cohesion, but instead have very high friction angles at low stress, due to strong dilation. Rock masses, implying problems of large-scale interaction with engineering structures, may have both cohesive and frictional strength components. However, it is not correct to add these, following linear M-C or nonlinear Hoek–Brown (H-B) standard routines. Cohesion is broken at small strain, while friction is mobilized at larger strain and remains to the end of the shear deformation. The criterion ‘c then σn tan φ’ should replace ‘c plus σntan φ’ for improved fit to reality. Transformation of principal stresses to a shear plane seems to ignore mobilized dilation, and caused great experimental difficulties until understood. There seems to be plenty of room for continued research, so that errors of judgement of the last 50 years can be corrected.},

The equation is based on three index parameters; the joint roughness coefficientJRC, the joint wall compressive strengthJCS, and the residual friction angleφ r . All these index values can be measured in the laboratory. They can also be measured in the field. Index tests and subsequent shear box tests on more than 100 joint samples have demonstrated thatφ r can be estimated to within ± 1° for any one of the eight rock types investigated. The mean value of the peak shear strength angle (arctanτ/σ n ) for the same 100 joints was estimated to within 1/2°. The exceptionally close prediction of peak strength is made possible by performing self-weight (low stress) sliding tests on blocks with throughgoing joints. The total friction angle (arctanτ/σ n ) at which sliding occurs provides an estimate of the joint roughness coefficientJRC. The latter is constant over a range of effective normal stress of at least four orders of magnitude. However, it is found that bothJRC andJCS reduce with increasing joint length. Increasing the length of joint therefore reduces not only the peak shear strength, but also the peak dilation angle and the peak shear stiffness. These important scale effects can be predicted at a fraction of the cost of performing large scale in situ direct shear tests.},

Joint deformation can take the form of normal closure, opening, shear and dilation. The resulting changes of aperture can cause as much as three orders of magnitude change in conductivity at moderate compressive stress levels. Even the heavily stressed joints found in oil and gas reservoirs may also exhibit significant stress-dependent conductivity during depletion, and during waterflood treatments. The magnitudes of the above processes are often strongly dependent on both the character and frequency of jointing. In this paper the results of many years of research on joint properties are synthesized in a coupled joint behaviour model. Methods of joint characterization are described for obtaining the necessary input data. The model simulates stress- and size-dependent coupling of shear stress, diplacement, dilation and conductivity, and of normal stress, closure and conductivity. These processes are the fundamental building blocks of rock mass behaviour. Model simulations are compared with experimental behaviour and numerous examples are given.},

This study focuses on the formation and geomorphological activity of the Akdag landslide complex located on the southern slope of Mount Akdag, SW Turkey. We employed detailed mapping in the field, spatial and morphometric analysis using GIS and remote sensing technologies, and surface exposure dating with cosmogenic 36Cl to reconstruct the chronology of the landslide complex. For the analysis of cosmogenic 36Cl, we collected 18 surface samples from calcareous boulders within the landslide deposit. Our field mapping shows that the Akdag rock avalanche is a large and active slope failure developed between carbonates and flysch. The rock-avalanche deposits cover an area of 9.8 km2 and together with the primary and secondary slope failures which form the landslide complex, cover an area of 15 km2. The Akdag rock avalanche is one of the largest (3×108 m3) known bedrock landslides in Turkey. Cosmogenic 36Cl exposure ages indicate that the main collapse occurred at 8.3 ± 1.4 ka (2), followed by secondary failures. We dated one of the latter to 1.1 ± 0.2 ka (2). Based on field evidence, we surmise that increased water discharge in the springs along the carbonate-flysch contact zone played a key role in the Early Holocene failure.},

The understanding of such a process and the resulting ejection of particles is, in particular, crucial to describe eolian sand transport. We present here an extensive experimental analysis of the collision and ejection process. The analysis is two dimensional in the sense that we determined only the vertical component Vz of the ejection velocity of the splashed particles and the horizontal component Vx lying in the incident plane. We extracted in particular the distribution of the ejection velocities for a wide range of impact angles θi and incident velocity Vi. We show that the mean quadratic horizontal velocity of the splashed particles is almost insensitive to changes in the impact angle and velocity, while the mean quadratic vertical velocity slightly increases with increasing impact velocity (as V1∕2i). Moreover, the mean number of splashed particles per collision is found to be dependent on both the impact angle and velocity, and to scale with the impact speed as V3∕2i. A consequence of these outcomes is that the sum of the kinetic energy of the splashed particles is directly proportional to the kinetic energy of the incident particle. Finally, we provide the bivariate probability distribution function P(Vx,Vz) of the ejection velocities and show that it can be approximated by the product of a log-normal distribution and a circular normal one.},

In the spring of 2010, a large reactivation of the earth-flow heavily damaged some strategic infrastructures. In order to mitigate the effects of the mass movement, considerable efforts were carried out by the Italian National Civil Protection Department (DPC) to tackle the emergency. The aim of the study was to contribute to a more accurate geometric reconstruction of the landslide body and to improve the knowledge of the geological setting. Due to the lithological characteristic of the outcropping lithotypes, i.e. Faeto Flysch (calcarenite, clay and marl) and Villamaina Unit (sand and silty clay), the electrical resistivity contrasts were not very pronounced. However, the high-resolution of the electrical tomographies was the key to observe the presence of both lateral and vertical discontinuities that were associated with lithological boundaries, structural features and sliding surfaces. The results of the geoelectrical surveys could be considered for planning additional and more appropriate actions aimed at the stabilization of different portions of the Montaguto landslide.},

  abstract = {The South Atlantic conjugate margins are the product of continental rifting and break-up of Pangea, which was made up of different crustal features prior to rifting. This study investigates continental rift initiation and break-up of alternative lithospheric setups, consisting of large segments with different rheological strength, with the use of analogue and numerical modelling. The analogue models investigate the effect of far-field forces on a system that consist of multiple rheological segments, whereas the numerical models include thermal processes and focus on the impact of initial plume emplacement on such a setup.Lithosphere-scale analogue models consisting of two different rheological compartments have been subjected to extensional forces, to understand effect of far-field forces on large rheological heterogeneities in a system within an extensional tectonic regime. The results show that in such a system, the weaker segment accommodates all the extension. At the contact between the two compartments no rift-initiation is observed. In the presence of a strong sub-Moho mantle, the rift evolution consists of two phases. The first phase is a wide or distributed rift event. Once the strong part of the upper mantle has sufficiently weakened, the rift localizes and a narrow rift continues to accommodate the extension. If extension would continue, break-up would happen at the location of the narrow rift, thereby breaking a rather homogenous part within a laterally heterogeneous system. This would result in asymmetric margins with hyperextended, weak crust on both margins.The numerical results show that, in the case of plume-induced continental break-up, the classical ‘central’ mode of break-up, where the break-up centre develops above the plume-impingement point is not the only form of continental break-up. When the mantle anomaly is located off-set from the contact between rheological segments, a ‘shifted’ mode of break-up may develop. In this case, the mantle plume material rises to the base of the lithosphere and migrates laterally to the contact between two rheological segments where rifting initiates. Mantle material that does not reach the spreading centre and remains at lower crustal depths, resemble high density/high velocity bodies at depth found along the South Atlantic margin and providing geometric asymmetry.Further investigation on the exact influence of the initial plume position with respect to the contact between the rheological compartments shows that there is a critical distance for which the system develops either ‘central’ (or ‘plume-induced’) continental break-up or ‘shifted’ (or ‘structural inherited’) continental break-up. For Moho temperatures of 500 – 600 oC, there is a window of \textasciitilde 50 km where the system creates two break-up branches. These results explain complex rift systems with both vertical penetration of plume material into the overlying lithosphere as well as reactivated inherited structures developing break-up systems both aided by the same mantle plume...},

We extracted knickpoints, landslide erosion rates, and topographic metrics across the region modified by Mendocino Triple Junction migration. Landslide erosion rates mapped from aerial imagery are consistent with modeled uplift and exhumation, while hillslope gradient is invariant across the region, suggesting that landslides accommodate uplift, as predicted by the threshold slope model. Landslides are concentrated along steepened channel reaches downstream of knickpoints generated by base-level fall at channel outlets, and limit slope angles and relief. We find evidence that landslide-derived coarse sediment delivery may suppress catchment-wide channel incision and landscape denudation over the time required for the uplift wave to traverse the region. We conclude that a landslide cover effect may provide a mechanism for the survival of relict terrain and orogenic relief in the northern Californian Coast Ranges and elsewhere over millennial time scales.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Efficient and robust landslide mapping and volume estimation is essential to rapidly infer landslide spatial distribution, to quantify the role of triggering events on landscape changes, and to assess direct and secondary landslide-related geomorphic hazards. Many efforts have been made to develop landslide mapping methods, based on 2D satellite or aerial images, and to constrain the empirical volume–area (\emph{V}–\emph{A}) relationship which, in turn, would allow for the provision of indirect estimates of landslide volume. Despite these efforts, major issues remain, including the uncertainty in the \emph{V}–\emph{A} scaling, landslide amalgamation and the underdetection of landslides. To address these issues, we propose a new semiautomatic 3D point cloud differencing method to detect geomorphic changes, filter out false landslide detections due to lidar elevation errors, obtain robust landslide inventories with an uncertainty metric, and directly measure the volume and geometric properties of landslides. This method is based on the multiscale model-to-model cloud comparison (M3C2) algorithm and was applied to a multitemporal airborne lidar dataset of the Kaikōura region, New Zealand, following the \emph{M}\textsubscript{w} 7.8 earthquake of 14 November 2016.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}In a 5 km\textsuperscript{2} area, the 3D point cloud differencing method detects 1118 potential sources. Manual labeling of 739 potential sources shows the prevalence of false detections in forest-free areas (24.4 \%), due to spatially correlated elevation errors, and in forested areas (80 \%), related to ground classification errors in the pre-earthquake (pre-EQ) dataset. Combining the distance to the closest deposit and signal-to-noise ratio metrics, the filtering step of our workflow reduces the prevalence of false source detections to below 1 \% in terms of total area and volume of the labeled inventory. The final predicted inventory contains 433 landslide sources and 399 deposits with a lower limit of detection size of 20 m\textsuperscript{2} and a total volume of 724 297 ± 141 087 m\textsuperscript{3} for sources and 954 029 ± 159 188 m\textsuperscript{3} for deposits. Geometric properties of the 3D source inventory, including the \emph{V}–\emph{A} relationship, are consistent with previous results, except for the lack of the classically observed rollover of the distribution of source area. A manually mapped 2D inventory from aerial image comparison has a better lower limit of detection (6 m\textsuperscript{2}) but only identifies 258 landslide scars, exhibits a rollover in the distribution of source area of around 20 m\textsuperscript{2}, and underestimates the total area and volume of 3D-detected sources by 72 \% and 58 \%, respectively. Detection and delimitation errors in the 2D inventory occur in areas with limited texture change (bare-rock surfaces, forests) and at the transition between sources and deposits that the 3D method accurately captures. Large rotational/translational landslides and retrogressive scars can be detected using the 3D method irrespective of area's vegetation cover, but they are missed in the 2D inventory owing to the dominant vertical topographic change. The 3D inventory misses shallow (\emph{\&lt;} 0.4 m depth) landslides detected using the 2D method, corresponding to 10 \% of the total area and 2 \% of the total volume of the 3D inventory. Our data show a systematic size-dependent underdetection in the 2D inventory below 200 m\textsuperscript{2} that may explain all or part of the rollover observed in the 2D landslide source area distribution. While the 3D segmentation of complex clustered landslide sources remains challenging, we demonstrate that 3D point cloud differencing offers a greater detection sensitivity to small changes than a classical difference of digital elevation models (DEMs). Our results underline the vast potential of 3D-derived inventories to exhaustively and objectively quantify the impact of extreme events on topographic change in regions prone to landsliding, to detect a variety of hillslope mass movements that cannot be captured by 2D landslide mapping, and to explore the scaling properties of landslides in new ways.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We measure fjord depths and widths from East Central Greenland (68°N–75°N), and find a control of lithology on fjord width, with wider fjords in softer rocks (i.e., sedimentary rocks). This dependency of fjord width to bedrock properties is predicted by a quarrying erosion law, but not by an abrasion one, when considering results from a simple two-dimensional model and a more detailed three-dimensional ice flow model (iSOSIA). Our analyses and numerical results reveal a potential control of lithology on the width of glacial valleys with glacial quarrying as a plausible responsible mechanism.},

  abstract = {Internal structures in four rock glaciers in the continuous permafrost zone on the island of Prins Karls Forland, western Svalbard (78°50′N,10°30′E), were studied utilizing ground penetrating radar (GPR). A comparative study was performed on the Brøggerbreen rock glacier close to Ny-Ålesund, about 50 km to the east. The bedrock interface was visible on some GPR profiles. Further, the length profiles revealed a system of reflectors that was comparable between the different rock glaciers. A layering structure parallel with the surface was visible in the upper part of the talus cones above the rock glaciers, while further down towards the rock glaciers these reflectors started to slant up against the surface slope. This inclination of the layers prevailed towards the fronts, although a more irregular pattern was discernible in the frontal part of some of the rock glaciers. The layering structure is probably formed by mass movements of higher magnitude, covering either snow patches or the active layer above supersaturated permafrost.

Previous studies proved that topographic roughness is closely related to both landslide mechanics and features. A number of different techniques have emerged over the years to describe quantitatively the great variety of landforms and processes that affect unstable slopes. In this work we perform a comparative analysis of several methods used in literature to compute surface roughness (root mean square applied to elevation and slope grids, eigenvalue ratios, semivariance, discrete Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform and wavelet lifting scheme) in order to evaluate quantitatively which algorithms are best suited to discriminate active landslides and to predict them for automated mapping purposes. A first test was carried out on artificial surfaces simulating different roughness patterns encountered in nature, so to highlight advantages and limits in controlled conditions. Then, the algorithms were applied to LiDAR datasets of two earth flow case studies in the Northern Apennines, Italy.},

  abstract = {Remnants of a Pleistocene landslide have been observed during field investigations of Quaternary alluvial formations of the Isle River at Petit-Bost, southwestern France. The main features of the landslide-induced deformation give a good indication of its size and depth. The surface of rupture is located in a 0.5 m thick, very plastic mottled clay at the top of an alluvial gravel. The clay is overlain by 1.7 m thick loamy colluvial deposits with a polygonal net of bleached wedges that testify to past permafrost conditions. The mechanical parameters used in stability calculations for the case of an infinite planar sliding surface, that fits well the geomorphological data, are given by triaxial tests. Stability calculation indicates that the slope is very stable at present and that rupture can only have occurred in fully unconsolidated and undrained conditions. This likely happened during permafrost degradation and subsequent thawing of ice-rich soil layers. Oedometric tests indicate post-sliding over-consolidation of the clay. With regards to the debate on permafrost distribution in France during the Pleistocene, this study gives support to a wide extent of permafrost, at least to the latitude 458N southward, during the coldest periods. It also points out that frostinduced slope instability may have played a major, but still underestimated, role in many French regions north to this latitude. D 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Evidence of deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSD) and of large prehistoric landslides is fairly widespread within the Central Apennines (Italy). These gravityinduced processes accompanied the intense Plio-Quaternary uplift phases that affected the mountain chain. In this study a multidisciplinary approach has been adopted in order to better constrain the relationship between the tectonic evolution and the gravitational morphogenesis of a typical Apennine morphostructure, such as the Caramanico Valley. For this purpose a conceptual model of the morphostructural evolution of the area has been reconstructed, on the basis of geological constraints derived by the integration of detailed geological-structural and geomorphological surveys with available literature data. Based on this evolutionary model, a multistage numerical modelling using the finite difference method code FLAC 6.0 has been performed in order to: (i) evaluate the effect of the uplift-related morphological changes of the valley-slope system; and (ii) assess the role of the horizontal/vertical stress ratio variations due to geodynamic regime shifts. The results of the numerical model show a good fit with the actual geomorphical evidence and also confirm the presence during some evolutionary stages of stress-strain conditions compatible with those necessary to produce the massive rock slope failures testified by the presence of large palaeo-landslide deposits.},

Based on critical analysis of earlier models, new interpolation of existing geophysical data and results of integrated modelling, a new map of the lithosphere thickness for the Carpathian–Pannonian region has been constructed. The map allows for the distinction of a frontal orogen collision zone in the NE (from increased lithosphere thickness) as well as a zone of oblique collision with the Bohemian Massif in the West, where lithosphere is not significantly thickened. The MOHO discontinuity beneath the Western Carpathian hinterland (Danube and East Slovak Basins), as defined by deep reflection seismic profiling, is relatively shallow. This probably reflects recent crustal extension related to oblique collision between the European plate and the ALCAPA block and an increase of the asthenospheric updoming from the Middle Miocene onward.},

Unlike most existing models, which are appropriate for evaluating in situproduced cosmogenic isotope abundance at discrete points on Earth's surface, our model is designed for interpreting isotope abundance in sediment. Because sediment is a mixture of materials, in favourable cases derived from throughout a drainage basin, we suggest that measured isotope abundances may reflect spatially averaged rates of erosion. We investigate the assumptions and behaviour of our model and conclude that it could provide geomorphologists with a relatively simple means by which to constrain the rate of landscape evolution if a basin is in isotopic steady state and if sampled sediments are well mixed.},

A second gravitational destabilization is well constrained at 7.1±0.5 10Be ka through the dating of two gravitational scarps.

Many events perceptibly affect the transport supply along these networks, especially natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and earthquakes. Contrary to more common disruptions of traffic from accidents, or maintenance closures, natural disasters are capable of destroying large numbers of roads and usually cover vast areas. When evaluating network damage no single measure alone is able to describe the full extent of network destruction. In this study, we investigated six highly damaging natural disasters, which occurred in the Czech Republic between 1997 and 2010. They were all induced by extreme rainfall or by rapid snowmelt and resulted in floods and landslides. Their impacts are evaluated with respect to the damage to road networks and decreased serviceability. For mutual comparison of the impacts and their analysis we used several criteria, described in the paper, related to economic impacts, physical harm to individuals and infrastructures, and the effects on connectivity and serviceability. We also introduced a new measure based on the network efficiency index which takes into account the importance of nodes based on their population. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of one such event in July 1997 that significantly affected the road network of the Zlín region.},

We estimated the total water content thresholds for the previously defined seven phases of increased landsliding which took place between 1939 and 2010 around the Napajedla meteorological station. The time series were reconstructed on the basis of data from surrounding stations. Rainfalls with the highest intensities ({$>$}1 mm/min) were removed from the set. Rainfall of such an intensity primarily causes overland flow and soil erosion and does not contribute to landslide threshold. The snow water equivalent was computed on the basis of the snow height, and possible errors were evaluated as interval estimations. An interval of 10 days before a landslide phase was selected for the total water content threshold. The resulting lower boundary (67.0 mm/10 days) and upper boundary (163.3 mm/ 10 days) thresholds of water infiltrated into soil during an event shall be part of the prepared online warning system in this area.},

  abstract = {Global warming is causing an apparent rapid retreat of many glaciers worldwide. In addition to mass-balance investigation, the determination and monitoring of total glacial ice volume and ice-thickness distribution are important parameters for understanding the interactions between climate and the complex glacier system. Because of spatially irregular and sparse datasets, scaling of volume and ice-thickness distribution is often a challenging problem. This study focuses on two small ({$<$}2 km2) temperate glaciers in the Hohe Tauern (Eastern Alps) region of central Austria. The period 2003–04 saw the first use of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to determine the total ice volume and ice-thickness distribution of the two glaciers. A centre frequency of 20 MHz was used in point measuring mode. Despite variable data quality, bedrock reflections up to depths of {$>$}100m were identified in the data. The acquired GPR data are irregularly distributed and the spatial density is too low to calculate reasonable bedrock topography with standard interpolation approaches. Thus one main focus of this study was to develop an appropriate interpolation technique. Eventually, kriging technique and a glacial mechanically based interpolation parameter were used. Mean calculated ice thicknesses for the two investigated glaciers are 40–50 m, with a maximum of 150–165 m. No direct validation data are available, so different considerations support the computed bedrock topography.},

  abstract = {Studies across a broad range of drainage basins have established a positive correlation between mean slope gradient and denudation rates. It has been suggested, however, that this relationship breaks down for catchments where slopes are at their threshold angle of stability because, in such cases, denudation is controlled by the rate of tectonic uplift through the rate of channel incision and frequency of slope failure. This mechanism is evaluated for the San Bernardino Mountains, California, a nascent range that incorporates both threshold hillslopes and remnants of pre-uplift topography. Concentrations of in situ–produced cosmogenic 10Be in alluvial sediments are used to quantify catchment-wide denudation rates and show a broadly linear relationship with mean slope gradient up to \textasciitilde 30°: above this value denudation rates vary substantially for similar mean slope gradients. We propose that this decoupling in the slope gradient–denudation rate relationship marks the emergence of threshold topography and coincides with the transition from transport-limited to detachment-limited denudation. The survival in the San Bernardino Mountains of surfaces formed prior to uplift provides information on the topographic evolution of the range, in particular the transition from slope-gradient–dependent rates of denudation to a regime where denudation rates are controlled by rates of tectonic uplift. This type of transition may represent a general model for the denudational response to orogenic uplift and topographic evolution during the early stages of mountain building.},

Hack’s scheme of dynamic equilibrium in landscape evolution was perhaps the major theoretical contribution to long-term landscape evolution between the 1950s and about 1990, but it essentially ‘looked back’ to Davis for its springboard to a viewpoint contrary to that of Davis, as did less widely known schemes, such as Crickmay’s hypothesis of unequal activity. Since about 1990, the field of long-term landscape evolution has blossomed again, stimulated by the plate tectonics revolution and its re-forging of the link between tectonics and topography, and by the development of numerical models that explore the links between tectonic processes and surface processes. This numerical modelling of landscape evolution has been built around formulation of bedrock river processes and slope processes, and has mostly focused on high-elevation passive continental margins and convergent zones; these models now routinely include flexural and denudational isostasy.},

  abstract = {Mountain topography is the result of highly scale-dependent interactions involving climatic, tectonic, and surface processes. No complete understanding of the geodynamics of mountain building and topographic evolution yet exists, although numerous conceptual and physical models indicate that surficial erosion plays a significant role. Mapping and assessing landforms and erosion in mountain environments is essential in order to understand landscape denudation and complex feedback mechanisms. This requires the development and evaluation of new approaches in remote sensing and geomorphometry. The research herein evaluates the problem of topographic normalization of satellite imagery and demonstrates the use of terrain analysis using a digital elevation model (DEM) to evaluate the relief structure of the landscape in the western Himalaya. We specifically evaluated the Cosine-correction and Minnaertcorrection methods to reduce spectral variation in imagery caused by the topography. Semivariogram analyses of the topography were used to examine the relationships between relief and surface processes. Remote-sensing results indicate that the Minnaert-correction method can be used to reduce the “topographic effect” in satellite imagery for mapping, although extreme radiance values are the result of not accounting for the diffuse-skylight and adjacent-terrain irradiance. Geomorphometry results indicate that river incision and glaciation can generate extreme relief, although the greatest mesoscale relief is produced by glaciation at high altitudes. At intermediate altitudes, warm-based glaciation was found to decrease relief. Our results indicate that glaciation can have a differential influence on the relief structure of the landscape. Collectively, our results indicate that scale-dependent analysis of the topography is required to address radiation transfer issues and the polygenetic nature of landscape denudation and relief production.},

This paper presents a simple interface between two open-source software systems, the GRASS geographical information system, and the R statistical data analysis language. The platform used here is GNU/ Linux, because both systems compile and install cleanly; R runs cleanly in Windows environments as well. The interface allows ¯oating point and category data to be passed both ways for raster map layers and sites ®les; NULL raster cells in GRASS interchange with NA (not available) values in R. Because both systems are developing rapidly and GRASS database internals change often, the interface uses ASCII transfer via temporary ®les generated by standard programs. The interface operates by running R from within the GRASS environment, and issues commands to GRASS programs through the R system( ) function. The accompanying code is constructed as an R package, and contains wrapper functions for R plotting, and for R analytical functions returning gridded output, such as trend surface and kriging prediction, kernel density estimation of point patterns, and bicubic spline interpolation. These typical spatial analytical techniques, also often available in some form in GIS, are amply buttressed in R by a large range of other statistical and graphical functions, giving substantial insight into the data or results being handled. The interface will be extended to vector data, and will be coordinated with other database integration packages in R and GRASS. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This database comprises a total of one hundred and eighty-two entries: the Atlantic Ocean hosts seventy-five giant landslides; the Pacific Ocean hosts sixty-seven giant landslides; and the Indian Ocean hosts forty giant landslides. To determine the spatial characteristics of each giant landslide, it has been necessary to georeference published maps using ArcGIS software coupled with global DTMs. Using the georeferenced outputs, it has been possible to measure the basic morphometric characteristics of each landslide such as its length, width, perimeter, area, and fall height. Landslide volumes have been calculated with a higher degree of certainty in thirty-five cases and with a lower degree of certainty in sixty-three cases while complete outlines of the landslide area have been defined in ninety-six cases. On the basis of these data, it has been possible to interrogate relationships between potentially significant variables. The age distribution of giant landslides on volcanic islands demonstrates that more than half of the records in the database occurred during the last 0.5~Ma. This global database of giant landslides on volcanic islands is hosted on the website of the Institute of Rock Structure \& Mechanics: https://www.irsm.cas.cz/ext/giantlandslides. From there, the records can be downloaded as a spreadsheet or as a kml file for interrogation in a number of geospatial software programs including ArcGIS and Google Earth.

  abstract = {Knowledge about the detailed processes linked to the existence of permafrost in rockslide fractures is sparse. Large parts of the Jettan rockslide are located right below the discontinuous permafrost limit in the arctic part of the alpine landscape of northern Norway. Combining four years of meteorological and rockslide deformation data with temperature measurements from different parts of open fractures, shallow bedrock boreholes and air, as well as daily snow cover observations, allows a detailed identification of the key processes involved. These field data are the basis for the development of a permafrost controlled rockslide model. Seasonally, the deformation has a very distinctive pattern with high deformation starting abruptly right after snowmelt in May, and lasting until snow isolation in winter. Then there is a gradual transition to medium deformation as the ground is cooled further for another 1–2 months. Finally, the winter period, when maximum snow occurs in the fractures, is characterized by limited or almost no deformation. The primary controlling deformation process is meltwater percolation into fractures in summer with significant refreezing, ice formation and temperature increase in the lower part of the fractures from −1 °C to 0 °C. Sporadic permafrost exists below the discontinuous permafrost limit, and may extend into open fractures and sliding planes. Another primary process is the significant cold air accumulation in fractures in early winter, due to the Balch effect, which significantly cools the fracture and surrounding rock promoting permafrost development. Finally, the cold air effect is stopped by snow isolation once enough snow has accumulated in the fracture by late winter. The deformation itself is thought to be controlled by changing shear strength of the brecciated sliding planes due to either changing ice temperatures and/or variations in water infiltration to the unsaturated sliding zones. The overall system is very locally controlled driving itself, and the effect of a future climate change can thus be of minor importance.},

  abstract = {Rock slope failure (RSF) occurs in different contexts but is typically reported either as (i) single-category inventories or (ii) single-site geotechnical monographs. Few studies have sought to evaluate the spatial incidence of all modes of RSF conjointly, and to infer scenarios of regional landscape evolution from observed patterns of cumulative rock slope overstressing. Here we present the results of a systematic inventory of rock avalanches, rockfalls, rockslides, and gravitational rock slope deformations in the Western Alps (France, Italy, Switzerland) conducted using satellite imagery made available in Google Earth as a detection tool, and aided by preliminary ground-truth checks. The inventory totals 1416 montane RSFs, impacting 9.1\% of the study area. Underpinned by GIS tools, the study further examines the spatial distribution of RSF with consideration for (i) predisposing factors (typically: lithology, geological structure), and (ii) preparatory factors (geomorphological process regimes that drives a given slope segment to the point of failure). The latter encompass slower variables (e.g., long-term crustal stress regime, cumulative residence time above equilibrium line altitudes) and faster variables (e.g., short-span glacier-related stresses, permafrost thaw, seismicity). RSF density patterns helped to define seven RSF super-hotspots (large diversity of RSF modes, up to 50\% of displaced rock masses/unit area), which define the most intensely overstressed areas of the Western Alps. These super-hotspots occur at sites where highly dynamic, thick, warm-based glaciers above the equilibrium line either intersected (middle Maurienne) or followed the strike of (middle Isère) N-S bands of highly susceptible lithologies and structures during the Quaternary. The widespread incidence of rock slope deformation (cumulative area: 1760km2, i.e., nearly 3 times the total of the other three RSF categories combined) appears further correlated with the low tectonic activity of the orogen and with its areas dominated by an extensional tectonic regime west of the Penninic Frontal Thrust. This contrasts with seismically active orogens, e.g., New Zealand's Southern Alps, where rock slope deformation is scarce compared to rock avalanches and shallow landslides.},

  abstract = {Mass wasting is an important process for denuding hillslopes and lowering ridge crests in active mountain belts such as the HimalayaKarakoram ranges (HKR). Such a high-relief landscape is likely to be at its mechanical threshold, maintained by competing rapid rock uplift, river incision, and pervasive slope failure. We introduce excess topography, ZE, for quantifying potentially unstable rock-mass volumes inclined at angles greater than a specified threshold angle. We find that ZE peaks along major fluvial and glacial inner gorges, which is also where the majority of 492 large ({$>$}0.1 km2) rock-slope failures occur in the Himalaya’s largest cluster of documented Pleistocene to Holocene bedrock landslides. Our data reveal that bedrock landslides in the HKR chiefly detached from near or below the median elevation, whereas glaciers and rock glaciers occupy higher-elevation bands almost exclusively. Less than 10\% of the area of the HKR is upslope of glaciers, such that possible censoring of evidence of large bedrock landslides above the permanent snow line barely affects this finding. Bedrock landslides appear to preferentially undermine topographic relief in response to fluvial and glacial incision along inner gorges, unless more frequent and smaller undetected failures, or rigorous (peri-)glacial erosion, compensate for this role at higher elevation. Either way, the distinct patterns of excess topography and large bedrock landsliding in the HKR juxtapose two stacked domains of landslide and (peri-)glacial erosion that may respond to different time scales of perturbation. Our findings call for more detailed analysis of vertical erosional domains and their geomorphic coupling in active mountain belts.},

  abstract = {The unstable rock slope, Stampa, above the village of Flåm, Norway, shows signs of both active and postglacial gravitational deformation over an area of 11 km2. Detailed structural field mapping, annual differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) surveys, as well as geomorphic analysis of high-resolution digital elevation models based on airborne and terrestrial laser scanning indicate that slope deformation is complex and spatially variable. Numerical modeling was used to investigate the influence of former rockslide activity and to better understand the failure mechanism. Field observations, kinematic analysis and numerical modeling indicate a strong structural control of the unstable area. Based on the integration of the above analyses, we propose that the failure mechanism is dominated by (1) a toppling component, (2) subsiding bilinear wedge failure and (3) planar sliding along the foliation at the toe of the unstable slope. Using differential GNSS, 18 points were measured annually over a period of up to 6 years. Two of these points have an average yearly movement of around 10 mm/year. They are located at the frontal cliff on almost completely detached blocks with volumes smaller than 300,000 m3. Large fractures indicate deep-seated gravitational deformation of volumes reaching several 100 million m3, but the movement rates in these areas are below 2 mm/year. Two different lobes of prehistoric rock slope failures were dated with terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides. While the northern lobe gave an average age of 4,300 years BP, the southern one resulted in two different ages (2,400 and 12,000 years BP), which represent most likely multiple rockfall events. This reflects the currently observable deformation style with unstable blocks in the northern part in between Joasete and Furekamben and no distinct blocks but a high rockfall activity around Ramnanosi in the south. With a relative susceptibility analysis it is concluded that small collapses of blocks along the frontal cliff will be more frequent. Larger collapses of free-standing blocks along the cliff with volumes {$>$} 100,000 m3, thus large enough to reach the fjord, cannot be ruled out. A larger collapse involving several million m3 is presently considered of very low likelihood.},

The method uses a digital terrain model (DTM) of the area and regionalised climate data to derive the soil regionalised variables that form the basis of the prediction. The method was tested using 94 soil profile samples in the Quaternary stratum of the Schatterbach test site, a 2387 ha investigation area in the Bavarian Tertiary Hills (Germany). The approach is based on the assumption that the shape of the landscape and the late Quaternary climate history determines slope development and soil forming processes. To develop the method, a suite of terrain- indices and complex process parameters was derived from DTM and climate data. Step-wise linear regression was then used to identify which of these terrain indices and process parameters were most useful in predicting the required soil attributes. Testing of the approach showed that 88.1\% of the variance was explained by a combination of the sediment transport, mass balance and solifluction parameters, providing a sound basis for the prediction of soil parameters in hilly terrain.},

In spite of that, in many studies few faults are identified in field and properly used in models of gravitational slope deformation. The aim of this work is to study the influence of inherited faults zone density and geometry on gravitational failure processes at the massif scale using a physical modelling technique which satisfies the similarity criteria. Models are scaled to the well-documented natural example of La Clapière in the Southern French Alps. Experiments were conducted using mechanically homogeneous material with variable fault geometry. In each of tested configurations, the mobilized volume was almost the same. Results confirmed the hypothesis that the La Clapière landslide is a shallow section of a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation. Furthermore, among the various configurations tested, only one is enable to reproduce the observed superficial deformation on the La Clapière hillside. This result demonstrated that the geometry of the faults at depth plays a major role on the style of gravitational deformation patterns. Regarding the particular case of La Clapière, our results give new insights on the shape of the faults affecting the massif at depth. In particular, normal listric faults seem to have shallow inflexions compared to a deep-seated thrust fault that was either gravitationally formed or pre-existing but inactive (i.e. sealed) before slope destabilization and then gravitationally reactivated.},

Previous 2-D physical modeling results demonstrated that even if few preexisting fractures are activated/propagated during gravitational failure all of those heterogeneities had a great influence on mobilized volume and its kinematics. The question we address in the present study is to determine if such a result is also observed in 3-D. As in 2-D previous models we examine geologically stable model configuration, based upon the well documented landslide at Randa, Switzerland. The 3-D models consisted of a homogeneous material in which several fracture zones were introduced in order to study simplified but realistic configurations of discontinuities (e.g. based on natural example rather than a parametric study). Results showed that the type of gravitational failure (deep-seated landslide or sequential failure) and resulting slope morphology evolution are the result of the interplay of initial topography and inherited preexisting fractures (orientation and density). The three main results are i) the initial topography exerts a strong control on gravitational slope failure. Indeed in each tested configuration (even in the isotropic one without fractures) the model is affected by a rock slide, ii) the number of simulated fracture sets greatly influences the volume mobilized and its kinematics, and iii) the failure zone involved in the 1991 event is smaller than the results produced by the analog modeling. This failure may indicate that the zone mobilized in 1991 is potentially only a part of a larger deep-seated landslide and/or wider deep seated gravitational slope deformation.},

  abstract = {Although studies have repeatedly focused on feedbacks and impacts of climate change on mass movements in the past, the inter-relations between climatic variables and debris-flow occurrence remain widely unclear and ambiguous to date. Most studies on past debris-flow occurrence remained rather isolated reconstructions for single torrents or they were restricted to short time periods. It is therefore the aim of this study to provide a regional chronology of past debris-flow events for the Zermatt Valley (Swiss Alps) and to go beyond the simple dating of events. Based on tree-ring reconstructed debris-flow histories of eight torrents, we shed light on changes and trends in debris-flow occurrence, climatic conditions prevailing during events and on potential evolutions in a future climate. Based on the analysis of tree-ring records of 2467 conifers (mainly Larix decidua and Picea abies), 417 events between ad 1600 and 2009 were assessed. Decadal frequencies suggest peaks in debris-flow activity after the end of the ‘Little Ice Age’ and for the period 1920–1929. In contrast, activity was rather low during the most recent part of the record (2000–2009), which is in concert with the observed decrease in the number of triggering rainfall events. Long-term trends in debris-flow occurrence were analysed for three time intervals of the period 1850-2009 with Student’s t-tests. For the debrisflow frequency of the entire valley, no significant trends can be observed over the last 150 years.We conclude that the occurrence of debris flows would depend on short-term changes in triggering rainfall rather than on long-term climatic changes.},

  abstract = {In tectonically active mountain belts, landslides contribute significantly to erosion. Statistical analysis of regional inventories of earthquake-triggered-landslides after large earthquakes (Mw\,{$>$}\,5.5) reveal a complex interaction between seismic shaking, landslide material, and rainfall. However, the contributions of each component have never been quantified due to a lack of in-situ data for active landslides. We exploited a 3-year geodetic and seismic dataset for a slow-moving landslide in Peru affected by local earthquakes and seasonal rainfalls. Here we show that in combination, they cause greater landslide motion than either force alone. We also show the rigidity of the landslide’s bulk clearly decreasing during Ml\,≥\,5 earthquakes. The recovery is affected by rainfall and small earthquakes (Ml\,{$<$}\,3.6), which prevent the soil from healing, highlighting the importance of the timing between forcings. These new quantitative insights into the mechanics of landslides open new perspectives for the study of the mass balance of earthquakes.},

  abstract = {Landslide inventory maps are necessary for assessing landslide hazards and addressing the role slope stability plays in landscape evolution over geologic timescales. However, landslide inventory maps produced with traditional methods — aerial photograph interpretation, topographic map analysis, and field inspection — are often subjective and incomplete. The increasing availability of high-resolution topographic data acquired via airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) over broad swaths of terrain invites new, automated landslide mapping procedures. We present two methods of spectral analysis that utilize LiDAR-derived digital elevation models of the Puget Sound lowlands, Washington, and the Tualatin Mountains, Oregon, to quantify and automatically map the topographic signatures of deep-seated landslides. Power spectra produced using the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform and the two-dimensional continuous wavelet transform identify the characteristic spatial frequencies of deep-seated landslide morphologic features such as hummocky topography, scarps, and displaced blocks of material. Spatial patterns in the amount of spectral power concentrated in these characteristic frequency bands highlight past slope instabilities and allow the delineation of landslide terrain. When calibrated by comparison with detailed, independently compiled landslide inventory maps, our algorithms correctly classify an average of 82\% of the terrain in our five study areas. Spectral analysis also allows the creation of dominant wavelength maps, which prove useful in analyzing meter-scale topographic expressions of landslide mechanics, past landslide activity, and landslide-modifying geomorphic processes. These results suggest that our automated landslide mapping methods can create accurate landslide maps and serve as effective, objective, and efficient tools for digital terrain analysis.},

  abstract = {Documenting spatial and temporal patterns of past landsliding is a challenging step in quantifying the effect of landslides on landscape evolution. While landslide inventories can map spatial distributions, lack of dateable material, landslide reactivations, or time, access, and cost constraints generally limit dating large numbers of landslides to analyze temporal patterns. Here we quantify the record of the Holocene history of deep-seated landsliding along a 25 km stretch of the North Fork Stillaguamish River valley, Washington State, USA, including the 2014 Oso landslide, which killed 43 people. We estimate the ages of more than 200 deep-seated landslides in glacial sediment by defining an empirical relationship between landslide deposit age from radiocarbon dating and landslide deposit surface roughness. We show that roughness systematically decreases with age as a function of topographic wavelength, consistent with models of disturbance-driven soil transport. The age-roughness model predicts a peak in landslide frequency at \textasciitilde 1000 calibrated (cal) years B.P., with very few landslide deposits older than 7000 cal years B.P. or younger than 100 cal years B.P., likely reflecting a combination of preservation bias and a complex history of changing climate, base level, and seismic shaking in the study area. Most recent landslides have occurred where channels actively interact with the toes of hillslopes composed of glacial sediments, suggesting that lateral channel migration is a primary control on the location of large deep-seated landslides in the valley.},

  abstract = {Models of the production of cosmogenic nuclides typically incorporate an adjustable production rate parameter that is scaled for variations in production with latitude and altitude. In practice, this production rate parameter is set by calibration of the model using cosmogenic nuclide data from sites with independent age constraints. In this paper, we describe a calibration procedure developed during the Cosmic-Ray Produced Nuclide Systematics on Earth (CRONUS-Earth) project and its application to an extensive data set that included both new CRONUS-Earth samples and samples from previously published studies. We considered seven frameworks for elevation and latitude scaling and five commonly used cosmogenic nuclides, 3He, 10Be, 14C, 26Al, and 36Cl. In general, the results show that the calibrated production rates fail statistical tests of goodness-of-fit. One conclusion from the calibration results is that two newly developed scaling frameworks and the widely used Lal scaling framework provide qualitatively similar fits to the data, while neutron-monitor based scaling frameworks have much poorer fit to the data. To further test the fitted models, we computed site ages for a number of secondary sites not included in the primary calibration data set. The root-mean-square percent differences between the median computed ages for these secondary sites and independent ages range from 7.1\% to 27.1\%, differences that are much larger than the typical uncertainties in the site ages. The results indicate that there are substantial unresolved difficulties in modeling cosmogenic nuclide production and the calibration of production rates.},

  abstract = {An 815-km2 area in Molise, central Italy, was used as a natural laboratory to characterise the lithological, topographic, and fluvial controls on the spatial distribution and frequency of active landslides in temperate climates. The study area is part of the central Apennines fold-and-thrust belt and is characterised by the presence of a tectonic mélange of scaly clays, known as Argille Varicolori, as well as more competent limestone and sandstone units. The area has been subjected to a cumulative stream incision of up to 400 m since the mid-Pleistocene. The landslide inventory was developed by combining satellite image interpretation and existing data sets, ground-truthed in the field. Statistical analysis of the inventory data demonstrates that the coupling between landslide occurrence in the area and lithology is strong, with landslides occurring 3–10 times more frequently where the mechanically weak Argille Varicolori (scaly clays) outcrops compared to other lithologies. Analysis of the relationship between landslide occurrence and hillslope gradients shows that 50\% of all landslides occur on slopes between 10 and 15°, despite this interval representing only 30\% of hillslope gradients in the study area. These results demonstrate the major control that the properties of the regionally significant Argille Varicolori have on landslide occurrence in the area, directly and through their control on hillslope gradients. Additionally, our results show that more than 50\% of the landslides occur at a distance of b260 m from the nearest stream, a value which is 4 times smaller than the median distance (\textasciitilde 1 km) between the interfluves and the valley floors within the study area. These data therefore demonstrate the important role that ongoing fluvial incision plays in governing the locus and frequency of landslides in an area in which the streams incise at rates of 0.4 to 0.7 mm/y. Finally, an analysis of the landslide size–frequency distribution revealed that the power-law exponent on the area term is 1.56 ± 0.2. This is toward the lower range of values published in the literature and suggests that in this part of the central Apennines active landslide frequency declines more slowly with size than is often modelled. More widely, this study provides new insights into the coupling between fluvial erosion and landsliding in an area of active tectonics and illustrates the fundamental role of lithologies such has the Argille Varicolori in determining landslide susceptibility.},

Empirical models show poor precision (75\%). 3D numerical models are too complex but 2D ones gave results that pointed out that real runouts exceed predicted ones by 30\%, possibly due to fluidization processes.

  abstract = {An accurate analysis of fracture and cleavage anisotropies along two landslides in the Argentera massif (French Southern Alps) was performed in order to relate the fracturing mode to the rock slope failure state. The mature La Clapière landslide and the incipient Isola Landslide were investigated. In both cases, the gneissic rock schistosity was found sub-horizontal in the vicinity of the landslides at shallow depths, while it was sub-vertical elsewhere at the massif's scale. In addition to the well known regional tectonic fracture sets, we identified in both cases a new family of vertical valley parallel (VP) fractures. The VP fractures were only observed on the lower part of slopes affected by landslides where schistosity was found sub-horizontal. The VP fractures are clearly related to the decrease in schistosity dip and correspond to ‘fold extrado’-like joints. The proximity of the schistosity folds and the associated VP joints to the landslides suggests that they are gravity-driven. The presented 2-D finite-difference models of the slope destabilisation in the La Clapière site shade light on possible mechanisms of the indicated gravity-induced processes. A progressive degradation of the material strength was imposed in these models to simulate the weathering effect which led to inelastic deformation/damage at the lower part of slope. This was followed by the formation of dense sub-vertical deformation bands and then by the initiation of a landslide in the area corresponding to the actual position of the La Clapière landslide. It is suggested that the gravity-induced damage in the lower part of slope increases the permeability and thereby accelerates the weathering that causes a more rapid strength reduction. The latter results in the tilting/folding of pre-existing fabrics and the related VP fracturing. The La Clapière landslide is initiated in the upper part of this zone.},

  abstract = {The climate of early Mars remains unclear and the debate is topical. Recently, climatic models have suggested a cold climate during the Noachian/Early Hesperian on Mars, which goes against the wet and warm climate often put forward. The purpose of this study is to seek geomorphologic evidence of this early cold climate. To achieve this, a step-by-step study of the geometry and morphology of several martian valleys has been done in the southern highlands. The analysis highlights the morphometric properties which enable the identification of martian glacial landscapes. We identified 100 cirques and 83 glacial valleys in two craters and on one mountain in the southern part of Terra Sabaea. The studied morphologies have the same morphometric characteristics and trends as terrestrial and martian glacial valleys and glacial cirques. In contrary, these trends are very different from those observed in fluvial valleys on Earth and on Mars. (1) The martian glacial valleys are U-shaped with a large flat floor and a V-index {$>$}0.20. While martian and terrestrial fluvial valleys are V-shaped with a V-index {$<$}0.1. (2) The length to width ratio is {$>$}1 while for fluvial valleys this ratio is ≫1. (3) Finally, the cross-sectional area and the elevation are higher for the glacial valleys compared to the fluvial ones. These glacial valleys often originate with a topographic hollow which have the same properties than terrestrial glacial cirque. The glacial landscapes identified in southern Terra Sabaea are restricted to elevations {$>$}1000\,m and are dated by crater counting to be 3.6\,Ga. This study strongly supports glacial processes as the origin of these valleys and cirques, and is the first morphometric evidence of glacial valleys associated with glacial cirques in the southern highlands in agreement with the climatic models. We propose that the martian climate during the late Noachian/early Hesperian was characterized by glaciated highlands at elevations {$>$}1500\,m and at lower elevations where fluvial valley network has been identified ({$<$}1500\,m) the climate was more temperate allowing liquid water to be stable and creating fluvial valley networks.},

Typical morphological evidence of slope movement includes extensive systems of tension cracks, grabens, and antislope scarps (collectively referred to here as linears). These landforms involve displacements along penetrative joints observed in surface exposures. Kinematic tests on rock-structural data indicate that the observed patterns of linears are generally consistent with the feasible gravitational movements along the dominant discontinuities. Most sites indicate sliding as the most likely initial mode of movement, followed by or accompanied by toppling and toppling-induced sliding movements, and do not support the view that linears are the traces of active faults.},

  abstract = {The dynamic fragmentation of rock during avalanche motion has been postulated as a mechanism explaining the long runout of large rock avalanches or Sturzströme. This paper investigates whether test conditions that produce dynamic fragmentation can lead to greater runout or spreading of physical model rock avalanches. Model avalanche experiments were carried out under enhanced acceleration to generate breakage in coal, a fragmentable, brittle solid. Coal blocks were released from a stationary position on a slope to run out on a plane. The motion of the ensuing fragmenting debris was captured using a high-speed camera placed above the horizontal plane. The average position of the front was tracked and the degree of fragmentation of the model avalanches was quantified. The paper presents results of the frontal velocity of the avalanches, corrected for centrifuge Coriolis effects. Comparison is made between the peak and impulsive front velocities, the final runout, and the degree of fragmentation of the model avalanches. Strong relationships are found between runout normalized by the cube root of volume, impulse velocity, and Hardin’s relative breakage parameter, BR. Results are discussed in light of the mechanics involved and are compared with field-scale events.},

It was triggered by a mainshock of the “Terremoto delle Calabrie” seismic sequence, and it induced a tsunami wave responsible for more than 1500 casualties along the neighbouring Marina Grande beach. Based on subaerial and submarine surveys, a 5 × 106 m3 subaerial landslide was identified together with a 3 × 106 m3 submarine scar area, whereas block deposits are present in both the subaerial and submerged regions. A detailed geological reconstruction of the slope was obtained and a geomechanical characterisation of the metamorphic rocks involved in the landslide was performed. Based on this reconstruction, intense jointing conditions of the rock mass can be related to main fault zones parallel and normally oriented to the actual coastline. An engineering geology model of the landslide was devised according to an equivalent continuum approach to evaluate both stiffness and strength of the rock mass within the slope. A finite difference stress–strain numerical modelling of the Scilla landslide was performed under dynamic conditions to back-analyse the landslide trigger as well as local seismic amplifications.},

  abstract = {The results of a study on gravitational induced lateral spreading phenomena are here reported. The lateral spreading processes are widely represented in the Italian Apennines due to the widespread overlapping of stiff rock masses on more ductile ones. The stress–strain evolution of these processes was investigated by combining an analogical and a numerical modelling approach. The analogue modelling reproduced the evolution of a carbonate ridge thrust over a clayey flysch with reference to the case-study of Mt. Roccatagliata–Mt. Sant'Angelo ridge. The rock mass juxtaposition was reproduced in a laboratory experiment by overlapping a brittle concrete on a viscous ductile material; these materials were selected with rheological properties, physically scaled with respect to the natural rock mass prototypes. The spreading phenomenon was modelled by opening horizontal panels in sequential stages and monitoring the resulting stresses within the ductile material during the experiment. A stress–strain modelling was also performed by an FDM numerical solution; this modelling replied the laboratory experiment by testing the use of different rheological constitutive laws. The resulting stresses and morphological evolutions are comparable with the analogical laboratory experiment only if a time-dependent rheological behaviour is assumed for the ductile material. The results show that lateral spreading processes can be properly investigated by combining analogue and numerical modelling techniques which take into account the viscous-plastic behaviour of the used materials.},

Analysis of the seismicity of entire Carpathian arc requires data from each of the particular catalogues which have to be properly and uniformly entered, standardized and merged. For our study we first had to prepare a database of seismic events (ML ≥ 1.6) compiled from the data of earthquakes taken from individual national seismic networks as well as data from international seismic centers. However, a careful review of these catalogues has uncovered significant inconsistencies, particularly discrepancies in the description of the location, magnitude and completeness of seismic events. To address these inconsistencies, a newly created compound earthquake catalogue was compiled from the aforementioned seismic catalogues and included events that occurred in the Carpathian Mountains arc area between 1976 and 2017. This work is intended to point out some of the problems associated with collecting data from various seismic catalogues as well as the need for their very careful verification, in order to create a uniform set of seismic data across a large area spanning numerous countries. The results suggest that compiling a uniform and dependable earthquake catalogue is crucial for reliable seismic studies.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the role that microseismic ground displacements may play in fracturing rock via cyclic loading and subcritical crack growth. Using a coastal rock cliff as a case study, we firstly undertake a literature review to define the spatial locations that may be prone to microseismic damage. It is suggested that microseismic weakening of rock can only occur in ‘damage accumulation zones’ of limited spatial extent. Stress concentrations resulting from cliff height, slope angle and surface morphology may nucleate and propagate a sufficiently dense population of microcracks that can then be exploited by microseismic cyclic loading. We subsequently examine a 32-day microseismic dataset obtained from a coastal cliff-top location at Staithes, UK. The dataset demonstrates that microseismic ground displacements display low peak amplitudes that are punctuated by periods of greater displacement during storm conditions. Microseismic displacements generally display limited preferential directivity, though we observe rarely occurring sustained ground motions with a cliff-normal component during storm events. High magnitude displacements and infrequently experienced ground motion directions may be more damaging than the more frequently occurring, reduced magnitude displacements characteristic of periods of relative quiescence. As high magnitude, low frequency events exceed and then increase the damage threshold, these extremes may also render intervening, reduced magnitude microseismic displacements ineffective in terms of damage accumulation as a result of crack tip blunting and the generation of residual compressive stresses that close microcracks. We contend that damage resulting from microseismic ground motion may be episodic, rather than being continuous and in (quasi-)proportional and cumulative response to environmental forcing. A conceptual model is proposed that describes when and where microseismic ground motions can operate effectively. We hypothesise that there are significant spatial and temporal limitations on effective microseismic damage accumulation, such that the net efficacy of microseismic ground motions in preparing rock for fracture, and hence in enhancing erosion, may be considerably lower than previously suggested in locations where high magnitude displacements punctuate ‘standard’ displacement conditions. Determining and measuring the exact effects of microseismic ground displacement on damage accumulation and as a trigger to macro-scale fracture in the field is not currently possible, though our model remains consistent with field observations and conceptual models of controls on rockfall activity.},

Criteria for determining whether a surface is eroding or undergoing burial as well as quantitative information on denudation or burial rates may be obtained from cosmogenic nuclide depth profiles. With the refinement of the physical parameters involved in the production of in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclides, a unique wellconstrained depth profile now permits determination of both the exposure time and the denudation rate affecting a surface. In this paper, we first mathematically demonstrate that the exponential decrease of the in situ-produced 10Be concentrations observed along a depth profile constrains a unique exposure time and denudation rate when considering both neutrons and muons. In the second part, an improved chi-square inversion model is described and tested in the third part with actual measured profiles.},

  abstract = {Cosmogenic nuclides are important tools to understand and quantify the processes that control the development and evolution of landscapes during the quaternary. Among all published studies, few are related to the accurate and precise determination of the physical parameters governing their production in the Earth’s crust surface (in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides) and its evolution as a function of depth below the Earth’s surface. Currently, it is nearly impossible to advocate global parameters that could be used worldwide. Indeed, at each sampling site, not only the geometry and the mineralogy will differ but also their evolution as a function of depth. In this paper, a new approach based on the measurement of the evolution of cosmogenic nuclide concentrations along depth profiles to determine the muon attenuation lengths is proposed. Contrarily to previous studies that used to describe both slow and fast muons, only one type of muons will be considered in this paper and nuclide accumulation at depth will be described by a single exponential. The determined attenuation length integrates the potential effect of the chemical composition of the overlying matrix and takes into account the entire energy range of the incident particles. Additionally, when denudational steady state is reached, muon contributions can be determined. When scaled to sea level, these contributions appear to be comparable for a given nuclide whatever the site where they have been determined. The average weighted muon contributions are 0.028 ± 0.004 atoms gÀ1 aÀ1 for 10Be, 0.233 ± 0.045 atoms gÀ1 aÀ1 for 26Al and 1.063 ± 0.329 atoms gÀ1 aÀ1 for 36Cl and are valid within the depth range 0–6500 g cmÀ2.},

Then, a 10Be enriched solution of known concentration being available, a STD-11 standard (10Be/9Be=(1.191±0.013)×10−11) that will be used at ASTER in the near future to calibrate 10Be measurements and its dilution to the 10−14 level (STD-14 (10Be/9Be=(5.468±0.064)×10−14)) have been prepared from it.},

  abstract = {For the last two decades, in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides are increasingly applied in Earth sciences to quantify surface processes. In parallel, significant reduction of the analytical uncertainties linked to advances in accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) allows more precise measurements. However, among all the published works on cosmogenic nuclides, only few studies are dedicated to a better understanding of their production systematic or to a better constrain of the physical parameters involved in their production. Thus, an approach to investigate in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides 10Be, 26Al and 36Cl along a single 11-meter long core drilled from the surface and composed of carbonates and quartzose conglomerates has been launched. These measurements have been used to quantify muon-induced productions based on natural samples for each studied nuclide. Contrary to the current most oftenly used calculation of muon-induced production parameters which are based on irradiation experiments at discrete energies, productions based on natural samples are considering the entire energy range of particles reaching the ground surface. The evolution of 36Cl concentrations with depth needs to agree with those parameters deduced from 10Be and 26Al data. This is optimized when considering a fast muon-induced 36Cl production contribution and a spallation production rate at Sea Level High Latitude (SLHL) of (42.0 ± 2.0) atoms 36Cl·g·Ca−1·a−1 (1 sigma uncertainty).},

Dating these deformations might help to determine degrees of present-day landslide hazard in that area. Based on the 10Be exposure dating of eight rocky scarps and walls of ridge-top trenches, we estimated the minimal ages of the deep-seated landslides (DSLs) and one deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) in the Satina River basin in the Moravskoslezske  Beskydy Mts. The obtained ages (\textasciitilde 9.7e2.9 ka) suggest Holocene slope instability in the area with a pronounced cluster of ages spanning from \textasciitilde 6.0 to 2.9 ka. Except for one DSL, the ages reveal rather episodic activity of gravitational movements. Mid-to early Late Holocene activity of large landslides in the study area corresponds to the ages of several previously dated landslides both in an adjacent region as well as within the Central European context. With respect to the historical quiescence of the DSLs and DSGSDs in the area and because the slopes have not been destabilized, even during the most extreme hydrometeorological events within the last few decades, we infer that the hydrometeorological thresholds necessary for their activation are seldom exceeded in this area. Therefore, the highest parts of the Carpathians built by rigid thick-bedded lithology reveal a rather lower frequency of events in comparison with adjacent parts formed by claystone-dominated flysch, where several large DSLs originated in the last few decades as a consequence of heavy rainfalls.},

A LiDAR-based inventory of deep-seated landslides (DSLs) in the highest part of Czech Outer Western Carpathians (Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mts.) reveals that nearly 20\% of the territory is affected by ancient DSLs. Rather than the topography itself, we show that the geological characteristics of flysch rocks control the density, scaling relationships and morphometry of DSLs. They reveal a strong tendency to clustering in areas with favourable structural conditions, such as cataclinal slopes of individual monoclinal ridges formed by thick-bedded sandstones. In comparison with high-mountain areas and regions dominated by weaker lithology (e.g., claystone-dominated flysch), sandstone-dominated monoclinal structure of the Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mts. features predominantly short-travelled DSLs that are arrested on slopes and thus reveal a higher slope gradient than non-landslide terrain. Finally, we propose a conceptual model for the evolution of DSLs on monoclinal flysch morphostructures, particularly where coherent sandstone caps overlie weak claystone/siltstone-dominated flysch. In these conditions, we distinguish between “low” and “high” monoclinal ridges, where the former is capped by relatively thin sandstones overlying claystone formations and sandstones predominate in the structure of the latter. We show that the density of DSLs on the cataclinal/dip slopes is similar on both types of monoclinal ridges, but that major differences exist in the evolution of anaclinal/escarpment slopes. Here, low monoclinal ridges are highly affected by DSLs, but escarpments of high monoclinal ridges are nearly devoid of any DSLs.},

Recent LiDAR-based inventory mapping reveals that the area of the COWC encompasses more than 13,500 landslides, with some geological domains exhibiting {$>$}\,20\% of the surface area covered by landslides. Although mass movements represent crucial geomorphic agents in the COWC, their timing and especially lifespan remain elusive. In this study, we focused on rockslides affecting the flanks of the flysch anticline developed within Paleogene sandstones. The area (“Hradisko” ridge) is well known as the most extensive rock city in the COWC. Structural-geological investigation, kinematic analysis and the application of near-surface geophysics (ERT, GPR and seismic refraction) suggest that rockslides accompanied by toppling and lateral spreads are predisposed by the architecture of bedding planes, joints and inherited faults cross-cutting the anticlinal ridge. Based on 10Be exposure dating of five scarps and rockslide boulders (a total of 25 cosmogenic-dated samples), we were able to reconstruct the long-term history of rock slope failures. Although the obtained ages of headscarp exposures reveal consistent patterns suggesting major mass movement phases at \textasciitilde\,18~ka and \textasciitilde\,12~ka, the interpretation of boulder exposure ages is ambiguous. The study area has not been affected by catastrophic slope failure in historic times, but dendrogeomorphic analysis reveals surprisingly strong tree ring signals of mass movements within the last 150~years. These findings suggest that progressive failure is developing within some parts of the rockslide and/or slope portions above the major scarp. We conclude the following: (1) some rockslide spots within the COWC might express a very long history, encompassing the full Late Glacial–Holocene Period; (2) major mass movement activity in the study site temporally coincided with the major climatic changes; (3) rockslides with a very long history still represent potential hazards, although evidence of their active movement is not detected by standard geomorphic mapping techniques and (4) dating of the scarps should be preferred as even a higher number of boulders might be unreliable.},

  abstract = {The recently emerged concept of “slope tectonics” suggests that mass movement processes can produce structures similar in morphological expression to that of extensional, strike-slip and compressional tectonic deformations. Further, there has long been debate about the (tectonic or gravitational) origin of lineaments found on hillslopes. Here we present cases of where geological structure and inherited tectonic structures have preconditioned the development of mass movements and creation of slope tectonic features on a monoclinal ridge (Smrk Mt.) in the Outer Western Carpathians, Czechia. Geomorphic mapping from LiDAR-derived topography, structural measurements, electrical resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar, were used to map synthetic and antithetic scarps, thrusts, and folds, and assess their relation to geological and tectonic structures. The scarps are found to be strongly related to transverse (NNW to NNE trending) inherited normal and strike-slip faults and mainly cross-cut the topography of the mountain ridge. Some of the folds are thought to have originated from buckling or compression in the distal parts of landslides. In other places, transpressional folds have developed oblique to major lateral shear surfaces interpreted to be sackung (mass movement scarps) that have been inherited from tectonic faults. The transpressional folds developed due to localized contraction along bends in the lateral shear surface as mass movement proceeded. Ramp-flat thrust folds developed in the compressional parts of landslides, where the landslide intersects with slope parallel sackung and/or inherited fault planes inclined to the slope. Altogether, this study demonstrates a connection between kinematics of deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs), shallower landslides and the origin of transpressive, ramp-flat thrust, and detachment structures in rock slopes.},

We focus our attention on the analysis of the precipitation annual cycle at the various stations and on the investigation of the vertical variability of both precipitation and temperature, averaged over the Upper Indus Basin (UIB) area. The precipitation annual cycle at the individual stations generally shows higher precipitation amounts in winter (December to April) than in summer (June to September), confirming that northern Pakistan is not under the prevailing influence of the Indian monsoon. The spatially-averaged temperature and precipitation vertical gradients show that the temperature lapse rate is consistent with the moist adiabatic lapse rate of the atmosphere. The vertical precipitation gradient indicates an increase with elevation until about 3,000 m and then a decrease that can be attributed to the strong underestimate of solid precipitation by rain gauges at high-altitudes.},

The importance of the dip and dip direction of the rear, basal and lateral release surfaces and their influence on failure mechanism, dilation, and the development of step-path failures is illustrated. The three-dimensional block shape and volume of the unstable rock masses simulated with the different discontinuity set geometries are characterized. Two assumed three-dimensional slope models are investigated in order to assess the importance of varying kinematic confinement/release mechanisms. These two assumed boundary conditions are shown to be critical in the development of asymmetrical rock mass deformation patterns. Scale effects due to the block size and discontinuity persistence are shown to control the calculated displacement and failure mechanisms. The numerical modelling results are also demonstrated to be sensitive to the assumed normal and shear stiffness of the discontinuities. The influence of the factors investigated on the failure of a single rock block versus a rock mass are compared and discussed.},

  abstract = {The Hope Slide, which occurred on January 9, 1965, involved an estimated 47-Mm3 of meta-volcanics and intrusive rocks. Previous workers reported the presence of tectonic structures (faults and shear zones) along the failure surface at the Hope Slide. These tectonic features were investigated in detail to assess their effects on rock-mass quality and the related implications for slope stability. This paper integrates basic field and laboratory concepts from structural and engineering geology. Subdividing the failure area into structural domains allowed distinct discontinuity sets to be associated with specific tectonic structures. The Geological Strength Index (GSI) was used to estimate the rock-mass damage related to the tectonic structures. Low GSI values were seen to outline tectonic damage zones. Point-load tests were used to characterise the compressive strength of rocks adjacent to the tectonic structures. Strength anisotropy, tentatively attributed to damage caused by a large shear zone, was observed in greenstone samples. Seepage zones along the failure surface were observed preferentially along shallow discontinuities that dipped downslope and in rock masses of good quality (GSI N 40). An alternative morphology of the slope failure is proposed by distinguishing between the extent of the surficial damage due to the rock-slope failure and the zone of failed material (depletion zone). For the first time, a kinematic mechanism for the Hope Slide is proposed, based on a preliminary 3-dimensional block model. A pre-1965 DEM was produced from estimates of material lost and gained as reported by previous workers. The pre-1965 DEM revealed that the tectonic structures recognised during fieldwork bounded the material that failed in the 1965 event.},

  abstract = {Rock slope failures are frequently controlled by a complex combination of discontinuities that facilitate kinematic release. These discontinuities are often associated with discrete folds, faults, and shear zones, and/or related tectonic damage. The authors, through detailed case studies, illustrate the importance of considering the influence of tectonic structures not only on three-dimensional kinematic release but also in the reduction of rock mass properties due to induced damage. The case studies selected reflect a wide range of rock mass conditions. In addition to active rock slope failures they include two major historic failures, the Hope Slide, which occurred in British Columbia in 1965 and the Randa rockslides which occurred in Switzerland in 1991. Detailed engineering geological mapping combined with rock testing, GIS data analysis and for selected case numerical modelling, have shown that specific rock slope failure mechanisms may be conveniently related to rock mass classifications such as the Geological Strength Index (GSI). The importance of brittle intact rock fracture in association with preexisting rock mass damage is emphasized though a consideration of the processes involved in the progressive-time dependent development not only of though-going failure surfaces but also lateral and rear-release mechanisms. Preliminary modelling data are presented to illustrate the importance of intact rock fracture and step-path failure mechanisms; and the results are discussed with reference to selected field observations.},

This paper presents three-dimensional numerical rock slope stability models and compares them with a previous conceptual slope instability model based on discontinuity surfaces identified using an airborne LiDAR digital elevation model (DEM). Rock mass conditions at South Peak are described using the Geological Strength Index and point load tests, whilst the mean discontinuity set orientations and characteristics are based on approximately 500 field measurements. A kinematic analysis was first conducted to evaluate probable simple discontinuitycontrolled failure modes. The potential for wedge failure was further assessed by considering the orientation of wedge intersections over the airborne LiDAR DEM and through a limit equilibrium combination analysis. Block theory was used to evaluate the finiteness and removability of blocks in the rock mass. Finally, the complex interaction between discontinuity sets and the topography within South Peak was investigated through three-dimensional distinct element models using the code 3DEC. The influence of individual discontinuity sets, scale effects, friction angle and the persistence along the discontinuity surfaces on the slope stability conditions were all investigated using this code.},

  abstract = {The process of interpretation, and the ways in which knowledge builds upon interpretations, has profound implications in scientific and managerial terms. Despite the significance of these issues, geomorphologists typically give scant regard to such deliberations. Geomorphology is not a linear, cause-and-effect science. Inherent complexities and uncertainties prompt perceptions of the process of interpretation in geomorphology as a frustrating form of witchcraft or wizardry — a dark art. Alternatively, acknowledging such challenges recognises the fun to be had in puzzle-solving encounters that apply abductive reasoning to make sense of physical landscapes, seeking to generate knowledge with a reliable evidence base. Carefully crafted approaches to interpretation relate generalised understandings derived from analysis of remotely sensed data with field observations/measurements and local knowledge to support appropriately contextualised place-based applications. In this paper we develop a cognitive approach (Describe-Explain-Predict) to interpret landscapes. Explanation builds upon meaningful description, thereby supporting reliable predictions, in a multiple lines of evidence approach. Interpretation transforms data into knowledge to provide evidence that supports a particular argument. Examples from fluvial geomorphology demonstrate the data-interpretation-knowledge sequence used to analyse river character, behaviour and evolution. Although Big Data and machine learning applications present enormous potential to transform geomorphology into a data-rich, increasingly predictive science, we outline inherent dangers in allowing prescriptive and synthetic tools to do the thinking, as interpreting local differences is an important element of geomorphic enquiry.},

Boulders were sampled from one early Wisconsin (               sensu lato               ) and six late Wisconsin moraines deposited by ice-cap outlet glaciers and local alpine glaciers. Four moraine boulders deposited during an extensive early Wisconsin ice-cap outlet glacier advance have a mean surface exposure age of 60,300±3200 yr. A moraine deposited by an ice-cap outlet glacier during the restricted late Wisconsin advance has a mean surface exposure age of 19,600±1400 yr. Five moraines deposited by late Wisconsin alpine glaciers have mean ages that range between 30,000 and 17,000 yr.

  abstract = {The coastline of Southeast Britain is formed in sedimentary rocks of Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary age, the majority of these deposits containing thick strata of mudrocks, which have very low angles of dip. Where these strata are appropriately exposed, particularly at the foot of a coastal slope, they give rise to landslides where all or part of the sliding surface follows a single bed of mudrock. Where the dip of the bedding is steep, such landslides are referred to as dip-slope failures. However, landslides where the basal sliding surface is controlled by the location and orientation of a single argillaceous bed in the sequence are better termed  bedding-controlled  landslides. In addition, where coastal slopes contain several layers of mudrocks, geometrically similar landslides may occur with perched slide surfaces breaking out at a higher level within the slopes. Landslides with strong bedding-controlled basal shear surfaces are the predominant form of instability along the southeast coastline of Britain. Many of the individual landslide cases used in this paper have been studied separately over many years. The general similarity of the different records is discussed, drawing important inferences on a number of aspects of these landslides with a variety of basal sliding surface geometries.},

  abstract = {If radiocarbon measurements are to be used at all for chronological purposes, we have to use statistical methods for calibration. The most widely used method of calibration can be seen as a simple application of Bayesian statistics, which uses both the information from the new measurement and information from the 14C calibration curve. In most dating applications, however, we have larger numbers of 14C measurements and we wish to relate those to events in the past. Bayesian statistics provides a coherent framework in which such analysis can be performed and is becoming a core element in many 14C dating projects. This article gives an overview of the main model components used in chronological analysis, their mathematical formulation, and examples of how such analyses can be performed using the latest version of the OxCal software (v4). Many such models can be put together, in a modular fashion, from simple elements, with defined constraints and groupings. In other cases, the commonly used “uniform phase” models might not be appropriate, and ramped, exponential, or normal distributions of events might be more useful. When considering analyses of these kinds, it is useful to be able run simulations on synthetic data. Methods for performing such tests are discussed here along with other methods of diagnosing possible problems with statistical models of this kind.},

Mt Ruapehu, the volcanic massif in the North Island's centre, is currently glaciated and probably sustained glaciers throughout the late Quaternary, yet no numeric ages have been reported for glacial advances anywhere on the North Island. Here, we describe cosmogenic 10Be ages of the surface layers of a glacially transported boulder and glacially polished bedrock from the Tararua Range, part of the axial ranges of the North Island. Results indicate that a limited valley glaciation occurred, culminating in recession at the end of the last glacial coldest period (LGCP, ca. 18 ka). This provides an initial age for deglaciation on the North Island during the last glacial–interglacial transition (LGIT). It appears that glaciation occurred in response to an equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) lowering of ∼1400 m below the present-day mean summer freezing level. Ages for glaciation in the Tararua Range correspond closely to exposure ages for the last glacial maximum (LGM) from the lateral moraines of Cascade Valley in the South Island, and in Cobb Valley, in northern South Island. The corollary is that glaciation in the Tararua Range coincided with the phase of maximum cooling during MIS 2, prior to the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR), during the LGCP.

The presence of Kawakawa tephra (Aokautere Ash) within loess c. 50 cm beneath the surface of the moraine has indicated that the moraine was formed prior to 27 ka, suggesting late MIS 3 glaciation in this sector of New Zealand. However, recently published 10Be cosmogenic dates from glacially-scoured bedrock and an erratic block on the surface of the moraine indicate that glaciation was much later, the corollary being that the Kawakawa tephra has been re-distributed post-eruption, perhaps from the ridgelines surrounding the moraine. Here, two optically-stimulated luminescence ages on the loess are reported that suggests most of the moraine was formed during late MIS 3 or early MIS 2, and that a readvance at c. 17.7-18.7 ka extended as far as the moraine.},

In New Zealand, valley glaciers at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) extended from an ice sheet centred on New Zealand's Southern Alps to below present-day sea level. In contrast, evidence of LGM glacial activity on the North Island is rare. Here, a glacioclimatic reconstruction is presented of two former glaciers in the Tararua Range (41 S) in the southern North Island. At Mt. Aston, an isolated cirque basin contains landform evidence of a marginal niche glacier. At Park Valley, the lateral moraine of a larger cirque glacier has yielded published cosmogenic isotope ages. The paleoglacier reconstruction shows that paleoequilibrium line altitudes increased northwards across New Zealand during the local LGM. Hence, at this latitude only topography {$>$}1200 m above present day sea-level was of sufficient elevation to allow small glaciers to form. The Mt Aston glacier covered only 0.18 km2 with an equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of c. 1287 m above present sea level. A mean ELA glacier thickness of c. 25 m gives a basal shear stress at the ELA of c. 100 kPaÀ1, with a mean summer (December, January, February, DJF) temperature at the ELA of no lower than 5.5  C below present, below which precipitation would have been insufficient to support the reconstructed glacier. Implied LGM paleo-temperatures from both the ELA reconstruction and the glaciological reconstruction broadly accord with other paleo-temperature proxies from the North Island. Park Valley glacier covered c. 0.45 km2 with an ELA of c. 1270 m and a mean ELA basal shear stress of 65 kPa. Its balance discharge was 9 Â greater than at Mt Aston. It appears to have been glaciologically viable across a wide range of paleotemperatures: thus, the more marginal glacier is a more useful paleoclimatic indicator because it places a maximum limit on LGM temperature depression, which the larger glacier does not. ELAs of both glaciers closely approximate the regional LGM ELA trend surface. The paleo-glacier reconstructions imply that together with temperature driving LGM paleo-ELA depression, changes in south-westerly airflow over New Zealand, bringing moisture-laden but cool air, maximized snowfall and minimised winter melt. The corollary is that patterns of Quaternary glacier fluctuations may be interpreted as responses, at least in-part, to precipitation-driven changes, and secondly, North Island glaciation was probably more extensive than previously assumed.},

  abstract = {Debris ridges in New Zealand are routinely assumed to be ‘moraines’ and used as key Southern Hemisphere paleoclimatic sites without detailed evaluation of ridge origin. Here we assess the origin of a debris ridge adjacent to Dundas Ridge in the Tararua Range, North Island, New Zealand, through measurements of ridge morphology and sedimentary properties. The ridge has a steep c. 35  distal slope (height 18 m), compared with the c. 19  proximal slope (height 6 m), and on all transects the distal slopes contain the coarsest material (median b-axis clast widths of 0.18-0.25 m), compared to distal samples (0.34-0.37 m). Clast shape (C40 range 40-60\%) and angularity (RA{$>$}65\%) indicate typically angular and ‘slabby’ clasts, and along with the lack of fines, and the ca. 40-m-distance between the ridge crest and the foot of the backwall, lead us to reject a glacial (moraine) origin for the ridge. The single ridge morphology precludes a protalus rock glacier origin, while the lack of a broad hillslope scar and debris apron beyond the ridge excludes a landslide origin. Instead, we interpret the ridge as a pronival (protalus) rampart formed by supranival debris supply–from the ca. 200 m-high southeastern slopes of Dundas Ridge–across a snowbed. Re-distribution of snow by prevailing westerlies from Mt Dundas Ridge into the basin would have nourished the snowbed, which is likely to have formed during the interval 24-18 ka BP, when a minor alpine-style glaciation affected sectors of the Tararua Range. This is the first pronival rampart detailed in New Zealand, raising the possibility that debris ridges of pronival origin may also be present elsewhere in New Zealand’s mountains.

  abstract = {A key problem in understanding valley evolution in alpine landscapes has been the lack of an independent timescale against which to measure morphological change. Here, we outline that by using space as a proxy for time, the role of glaciation in producing ‘classic’ U-shaped valleys can be quantified. The Two Thumb Range in New Zealand's central Southern Alps is undergoing rapid tectonic transport and uplift as it is advected towards the Alpine Fault. Repeated cycles of glacial erosion during the Quaternary have fashioned an alpine landscape in the north of the range, close to the Main Divide and Alpine Fault, while valleys in the less glaciated south of the range have rounded divides and convex fluvial cross-profiles. Using known rates of tectonic transport and uplift of the Southern Alps, coupled with an offshore oxygen isotope (δ18O) record from the Chatham Rise and glacio-geological reconstructions, time constraints can be applied to the erosional development of valleys. It is possible to estimate the duration of glacial occupancy of valleys in the Two Thumb Range, and the pattern is one of very limited glaciation of the southern valleys, with glacial occupancy increasing northwards. The key trend identifiable is that valley cross-profiles become U-shaped with c. 400–600 kyr of glacial occupancy. Other models have shown a “flattening” of valley long-profiles with increased glaciation, implying glaciers erode larger volumes of rock from mountains than rivers. From a cross-profile perspective, the simple change in geometry from V- to U-shape concurs with these models. Indeed, the transition from V- to U-shape with increasing relief and glaciation indicates glaciers may erode greater volumes of rock from mountain belts than rivers.},

Two segments, the Lúka and Kriváň, are distinguished in the Malá Fatra Mts., both with large granite plutons. This paper deals with the granitoid rocks of the Kriváň segment. On the basis of their mineralogy and geochemistry the hybrid and Magura granite types of Ivanov \& Kamenický (1957) were redefined as I- and S-type granitoids, respectively. The I-type granodiorites and tonalites have a characteristic mineral assemblage of plagioclase (An21–48), Mg-biotite, epidote, interstitial K-feldspar, allanite, hornblende and zircons with I. T. parameter above 350. They are situated mainly on the southern slopes of the Kriváň part of the Malá Fatra Mts. The Al-in-hornblende barometer gives a pressure of 330 ± 60 MPa, the zircon and monazite saturation temperatures are between 745–810 °C and 750–810 °C, respectively. The water content of the granitoid magma, estimated on the basis of biotite composition, was about 5 wt. \% at 700 °C. This granite suite also contains mafic magmatic enclaves. The S-types granites are localized to the north of the I -type granitoids. They contain plagioclase (An12–35), Fe-biotite, K-feldspar and zircons with I. T. parameter below 300–350. In the absence of hornblende, we suppose the same pressure (330 MPa) for the emplacement of this granite suite. The zircon and monazite saturation temperatures are also within the same range as in the I-type granites (740–790 °C or 720–790 °C). However, the biotite of the S-type granites suggest a lower water content of about 2–4 wt. \% at 750 °C. It is noteworthy that according to increasing body of data, the granitoid massifs in a 200 km long region in the present erosion cut between the Malé Karpaty and Malá Fatra Mts. were emplaced at similar temperature and pressure conditions. The pressures of 300–400 MPa indicate the similar 12–15 km emplacement depth of all the granitoid bodies in this area.},

  abstract = {Automated approaches for identifying different types of glaciated landscapes using digitally processed elevation data were evaluated. We tested the ability of geomorphic measures (e.g. elevation, relative relief, roughness, and slope gradient) derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) to differentiate glaciated landscapes using maximum likelihood classification and artificial neural networks (ANN). The automated methods were trained and validated using an existing Quaternary geology map and a manual interpretation of the contour data portrayed on topographic quadrangles. The need for such methods arises from efforts to classify types of landscapes (e.g. ecoregions) in Michigan. One fundamental control of the landscape structure in Michigan, including soil type and vegetation, is the underlying sedimentary and landform assemblages produced by an array of glacial processes during the waning phase of the Pleistocene. Traditional methods for identifying different landscapes (e.g. ice-contact landscapes, stagnation landscapes) have relied on printed topographic maps and have been very effective, bul: time consuming. The maps resulting from the four supervised classification trials had between 51\% and 61\% agreement with the original Quaternary geology map. The output from the maximum likelihood classification had slightly higher agreements than the output from the neural net, which is attributed to the generalization inherent in the Quaternary geology map compared with the nature of the classifier for the neural net. The neural net, however, identifies significant detail and non-linear relationships between classification inputs and output classes. Future work should incorporate a map of soils into the classification. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {We completed a systematic mapping of landslides in a 105 km2 area in Tithonium and Ius Chasmata, Valles Marineris, Mars, where landslides are abundant. Using visual interpretation of medium to highresolution optical images, we mapped and classified the geometry of 219 mass wasting features, including rock slides, complex/compound failures, rock avalanches, debris flows, and rock glacier-like features, for a total landslide area of ALT = 4.4 × 104 km2, 44\% of the study area, a proportion larger than previously recognised. Studying the landslide inventory, we showed that the probability density of landslide area p( AL) follows a power law, with a scaling exponent α = −1.35 ± 0.01, significantly different from the exponents found for terrestrial landslides, α = −2.2 and α = −2.4. This indicates that the proportion of large landslides ( AL {$>$} 107 m2) is larger on Mars than on Earth. We estimated the volume (V L) of a subset of 49 deep-seated slides in our study area and found that the probability density of landslide volume p(V L) obeys a power law trend typical of terrestrial rock falls and rock slides, with a slope β = −1.03 ± 0.01. From the combined analysis of landslide area and volume measurements, we obtained a power law dependency comparable to a similar relationship obtained for terrestrial bedrock landslides, V L = (1.2 ± 0.8) × AL(1.25±0.03). From the fall height HL and run out length LL of a subset of 83 slides unaffected by topographic confinement, we obtained the mobility index (Heim’s ratio) HL/LL, a measure of the apparent friction angle of the failed materials, φ = 14.4◦ ± 0.4◦. Slope stability simulations and back analyses performed adopting a Limit Equilibrium Method, and using Monte Carlo approaches on failed and stable slopes, suggest that the large landslides in Valles Marineris were seismically induced.},

We determine the probability density of landslide volumes, p(VL), using kernel density estimation. Each landslide dataset exhibits heavy tailed (self-similar) behaviour for their frequency-size distributions, p(VL) as a function of VL, for failures exceeding different threshold volumes, VL∗, for each dataset. These non-cumulative heavy-tailed distributions for each dataset are negative power-laws, with exponents 1.0≤β≤1.9, and averaging β≈1.3. The scaling behaviour of VL for the ensemble of the 19 datasets is over 17 orders of magnitude, and is independent of lithological characteristics, morphological settings, triggering mechanisms, length of period and extent of the area covered by the datasets, presence or lack of water in the failed materials, and magnitude of gravitational fields. We argue that the statistics of landslide volume is conditioned primarily on the geometrical properties of the slope or rock mass where failures occur. Differences in the values of the scaling exponents reflect the primary landslide types, with rock falls exhibiting a smaller scaling exponent (1.1≤β≤1.4) than slides and soil slides (1.5≤β≤1.9). We argue that the difference is a consequence of the disparity in the mechanics of rock falls and slides.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Alluvial fan and terrace formation is traditionally interpreted as a fluvial system response to Quaternary climate oscillations under the backdrop of slow and steady tectonic activity. However, several recent studies challenge this conventional wisdom, showing that such landforms can evolve rapidly as a geomorphic system responds to catastrophic and stochastic events, like large-magnitude mass wasting. Here, we contribute to this topic through a detailed field, geochronological, and numerical modelling investigation of thick (\emph{\&gt;}50 m) alluvial sequences in the Klados catchment in southwestern Crete, Greece. The Klados River catchment lies in a Mediterranean climate, is largely floored by carbonate bedrock, and is characterised by well-preserved alluvial terraces and inset fans at the river mouth that exceed the volumes of alluvial deposits in neighbouring catchments of similar size. Previous studies interpreted the genesis and evolution of these deposits to result from a combination of Pleistocene sea-level variation and the region's long-term tectonic activity. We show that the \emph{\&gt;}20 m thick lower fan unit, previously thought to be late Pleistocene in age, unconformably buries a paleoshoreline uplifted in the first centuries CE, placing the depositional age of this unit firmly in the late Holocene. The depositional timing is supported by seven new radiocarbon dates that indicate middle to late Holocene ages for the entire fan and terrace sequence. Furthermore, we report new evidence of a previously unidentified valley-filling landslide deposit that is locally 100 m above the modern stream elevation, and based on cross-cutting relationships, it predates the alluvial sequence. Observations indicate the highly erodible landslide deposit as the source of the alluvial fill sediment. We identify the likely landslide detachment area as a large rockfall scar at the steepened head of the catchment. A landslide volume of 9.08×10\textsuperscript{7} m\textsuperscript{3} is estimated based on volume reconstructions of the mapped landslide deposit and the inferred scar location. We utilise landslide runout modelling to validate the hypothesis that a high-magnitude rockfall would pulverise and send material downstream, filling the valley up to ∼100 m. This partial liquefaction is required for the rockfall to form a landslide body of the extent observed in the valley and is consistent with the sedimentological characteristics of the landslide deposit. Based on the new age control and the identification of the landslide deposit, we hypothesise that the rapid post-landslide aggradation and incision cycles of the alluvial deposits are not linked to long-term tectonic uplift or climate variations but rather stochastic events such as mobilisation of sediment in large earthquakes, storm events, or ephemeral blockage in the valley's narrow reaches. The Klados case study represents a model environment for how stochastically driven events can mimic climate-induced sedimentary archives and lead to deposition of thick alluvial sequences within hundreds to thousands of years, and it illustrates the ultrasensitivity of mountainous catchments to external perturbations after catastrophic events.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {© 2016 The Authors Earth Surface Processes and Landforms Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd. Landslides contribute to dismantle active mountain ranges and faults control the location of landslides. Yet, evidence of the long-term, regional dependency of landslides on active faults is limited. Previous studies focused on the transient effects of earthquakes on slope stability in compressive and transcurrent regimes. Here we show that in the Peloritani range, NE Sicily, Italy, one of the fastest uplifting areas in the Mediterranean, a clear geographical association exists between large bedrock landslides and active normal faults of the Messina Straits graben. By interpreting aerial photographs, we mapped 1590 landslides and sackungs and 626 fault elements and their facets in a 300 km2 area in the eastern part of the range. We used the new landslide and fault information, in combination with prior geological and seismic information, to investigate the association between bedrock landslides and faults. We find that the distribution and abundance of landslides is related to the presence of large active normal faults, and matches the pattern of the local historical seismicity. Landslide material is more abundant along the East Peloritani Fault System where the long-term activity of the faults, measured by the average yearly geological moment rate, is larger than in the West Peloritani Fault System where landslides are less abundant. Along the fault systems landslide material concentrates where the cumulated fault throws are largest. We conclude that large landslides and their cumulated volume are sensitive to local rates of tectonic deformation, and discriminate the deformation of the single fault segments that dissect the Peloritani range. Our findings are a direct test of landscape evolution models that predict higher rates of landslide activity near active faults. Our work opens up the possibility of exploiting accurate landslide and fault maps, in combination with geological and seismic information, to characterize the long-term seismic history of poorly instrumented active regions.},

The Sandstone/Pelite (S/P) ratio and structural complexity were determined. Geo-structural and geo-mechanical surveys were undertaken in situ and rock samples were tested in the laboratory. A map of the S/P ratio was produced showing the bedrock divided in four classes. Three ranges of GSI values were identified. The values of the intact UCS and of the constant mi were appropriately reduced to reflect the variable presence of sandstone compared with the pelitic fraction. A ‘‘weighted average’’ of the intact strength properties of the hard and weak layers was adopted. The values for the intact materials were reduced from 20 to 60\% depending on the GSI categories of the heterogeneous rock mass. In this way, seven classes of rock masses characterized by different values of GSI, reduced UCS and mi values were identified.},

The uplifted limbs of these folds comprise weakly indurated Cenozoic strata that mantle well-lithified Palaeozoic bedrock. Their contact is a regionally extensive unconformity that provides a persistent and readily traceable marker horizon. Based on the deformation of this marker, preserved fold geometries support simple geometric models for along-strike gradients in fold amplitude and displacement along the underlying faults, linkage among multiple structures, transfer of displacement among folds and evolution of the folds as geomorphic entities. Subsequent to initial uplift and warping of the unconformity surface, steeply dipping reverse faults cut the forelimbs of many of these folds. Wind gaps, water gaps, recent faulting and progressive stripping of the more readily eroded Cenozoic strata indicate the ongoing lateral propagation and vertical growth of fault-related folds. The defeat of formerly antecedent rivers coincides in several places with marked increases in erosional resistance where their incising channels first encountered Palaeozoic bedrock. Persistent dip angles on the backlimbs of folds indicate strikingly uniform geometries of the underlying faults as they propagate both laterally and vertically through the crust. Deformation switches irregularly forward and backward in both time and space among multiple active faults and folds with no systematic pattern to the migration of deformation. This distributed deformation appears characteristic of the entire Kyrgyz Tien Shan.},

(Tatric Superunit – Central Western Carpathians), were studied. The suggested process for their formation was the progressive melting of the same metapelitic source under differing P–T–aH2O conditions during shearing. The migmatitic leucosomes started to form by vapour-present partial melting. As the melting developed, with increasing temperature and stress, muscovite dehydration–melting under both vapour-present and vapour-absent conditions was continued, giving rise to the formation of leucogranite melt pockets of different size. Coupled feldspargoverned fractionation and restite removal influenced the chemical and mineralogical zonation in leucogranite bodies, accumulated in the pressure shadows. No fractionation was observed in migmatitic leucosomes. U–Pb TIMS and LA-MC-ICP-MS zircon and monazite ages obtained from anatectic leucosome and leucogranite indicate that the partial melts crystallized at ca. 360–365 Ma. The zircon U–Pb ages reflect the span of time encompassing partial melting, melt separation and crystallization. The effect of the incipient crystallization of the partial melt is recorded by the inner part of the isometric zircons (Th/U b 0.1) which yielded an age of 365.1 ± 2.4 Ma (2σ). Their growth continued until the metamorphic climax at ca. 750 °C and 8 kbar. Elongate zircons (Th/U N 0.1) yielding an age of 360.5 ± 1.9 Ma (2σ) crystallized during initial cooling accompanied by melt crystallization. The two zircon populations bracket the time interval during which the analyzed monazite-(Ce) crystallized (ca. 365–360 Ma). The U–Pb age of the leucogranite zircons (359.1 ± 1.2 Ma) supports the thesis that the leucogranites crystallized from melt expelled from the migmatised metapelites.},

  abstract = {Under climate change thawing permafrost will cause old carbon which is currently frozen and inert to become vulnerable to decomposition and release into the climate system. This paper develops a simple framework for estimating the impact of this permafrost carbon release on the global mean temperature (P-GMT). The analysis is based on simulations made with the Hadley Centre climate model (HadGEM2-ES) for a range of representative CO2 concentration pathways. Results using the high concentration pathway (RCP 8.5) suggest that by 2100 the annual methane (CH4) emission rate is 2–59 Tg CH4 yr−1 and 50–270 Pg C has been released as CO2 with an associated P-GMT of 0.08–0.36 ◦C (all 5th–95th percentile ranges). P-GMT is considerably lower – between 0.02 and 0.11 ◦C – for the low concentration pathway (RCP2.6). The uncertainty in climate model scenario causes about 50 \% of the spread in P-GMT by the end of the 21st century. The distribution of soil carbon, in particular how it varies with depth, contributes to about half of the remaining spread, with quality of soil carbon and decomposition processes contributing a further quarter each. These latter uncertainties could be reduced through additional observations. Over the next 20–30 yr, whilst scenario uncertainty is small, improving our knowledge of the quality of soil carbon will contribute significantly to reducing the spread in the, albeit relatively small, P-GMT.},

  abstract = {New technologies for innovative interactive experience represent a powerful medium to deliver cultural heritage content to a wider range of users. Among them, Natural User Interfaces (NUI), i.e. non-intrusive technologies not requiring to the user to wear devices nor use external hardware (e.g. keys or trackballs), are considered a promising way to broader the audience of specific cultural heritage domains, like the navigation/interaction with digital artworks presented on wall-sized displays. Starting from a collaboration with a worldwide famous Italian designer, we defined a NUI to explore 360 panoramic artworks presented on wall-sized displays, like virtual reconstruction of ancient cultural sites, or rendering of imaginary places. Specifically, we let the user to "move the head" as way of natural interaction to explore and navigate through these large digital artworks. To this aim, we developed a system including a remote head pose estimator to catch movements of users standing in front of the wall-sized display: starting from a central comfort zone, as users move their head in any direction, the virtual camera rotates accordingly. With NUIs, it is difficult to get feedbacks from the users about the interest for the point of the artwork he/she is looking at. To solve this issue, we complemented the gaze estimator with a preliminary emotional analysis solution, able to implicitly infer the interest of the user for the shown content from his/her pupil size. A sample of 150 subjects was invited to experience the proposed interface at an International Design Week. Preliminary results show that the most of the subjects were able to properly interact with the system from the very first use, and that the emotional module is an interesting solution, even if further work must be devoted to address specific situations. © 2016 for this paper by its authors.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Landslides are the main source of sediment in most mountain ranges. Rivers then act as conveyor belts, evacuating landslide-derived sediment. Sediment dynamics are known to influence landscape evolution through interactions among landslide sediment delivery, fluvial transport and river incision into bedrock. Sediment delivery and its interaction with river incision therefore control the pace of landscape evolution and mediate relationships among tectonics, climate and erosion. Numerical landscape evolution models (LEMs) are well suited to study the interactions among these surface processes. They enable evaluation of a range of hypotheses at varying temporal and spatial scales. While many models have been used to study the dynamic interplay between tectonics, erosion and climate, the role of interactions between landslide-derived sediment and river incision has received much less attention. Here, we present HyLands, a hybrid landscape evolution model integrated within the TopoToolbox Landscape Evolution Model (TTLEM) framework. The hybrid nature of the model lies in its capacity to simulate both erosion and deposition at any place in the landscape due to fluvial bedrock incision, sediment transport, and rapid, stochastic mass wasting through landsliding. Fluvial sediment transport and bedrock incision are calculated using the recently developed Stream Power with Alluvium Conservation and Entrainment (SPACE) model. Therefore, rivers can dynamically transition from detachment-limited to transport-limited and from bedrock to bedrock–alluvial to fully alluviated states. Erosion and sediment production by landsliding are calculated using a Mohr–Coulomb stability analysis, while landslide-derived sediment is routed and deposited using a multiple-flow-direction, nonlinear deposition method. We describe and evaluate the HyLands 1.0 model using analytical solutions and observations. We first illustrate the functionality of HyLands to capture river dynamics ranging from detachment-limited to transport-limited conditions. Second, we apply the model to a portion of the Namche Barwa massif in eastern Tibet and compare simulated and observed landslide magnitude–frequency and area–volume scaling relationships. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of explicitly simulating landsliding and sediment dynamics over longer timescales for landscape evolution in general and river dynamics in particular. With HyLands we provide a new tool to understand both the long- and short-term coupling between stochastic hillslope processes, river incision and source-to-sink sediment dynamics.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Detailed geomorphological mapping, combined with the analysis of aerial photography, enabled us to build two landslide inventories. One inventory including landslides before 1975 was used to create statistical models, whereas the other inventory including landslides after 1975 was used to validate the models. Geology, slope angle, slope aspect, distance to hydrographic elements, and distance to tectonic lineaments were considered as landslide-predisposing factors. To quantify the importance of DSGSDs as another landslide-predisposing factor, the DSGSD presence/absence map was introduced in the stepwise statistical analysis. The landslide inventory maps and factor maps were processed using a conditional analysis on all possible factor combinations to produce landslide susceptibility maps with five susceptibility classes. The results indicate that the DSGSDs significantly affect landslide distribution.},

  abstract = {The causes of landslides generally invoked in the Northern Apennines of Italy do not fully explain some observed oriented distributions of large landslides along regional-scale tectonic structures (late orogenic antiforms). The aim of the work is to deeply explore the role of tectonics in controlling the development and arrangement of large landslides. We employed a multidisciplinary approach which took into account geomorphological and geological field data, topographic analysis and deep seismic reflection profiles integrated with previously published apatite fission track cooling ages, shallow geophysical and GPS data. In order to explore these relationships, the Valmozzola area was selected as suitable case study, owing to the presence of clearly expressed relationships between recent extensional faults and related fractures and elements of active landslides. Moreover, in the Valmozzola area contractional tectonics acted to produce rock uplift and thus topographic growth. These processes caused hillslopes to approach their threshold angle, and promoted landslides triggered mainly by climate factors. The geological and geomorphological features characterizing the Valmozzola case study affect the entire study area, as they evolved during the same tectonic and climatic phases that characterized this part of the Northern Apennines. Therefore, the results from the Valmozzola area act as a proxy to constrain the control exerted by tectonics on large landslides across a wider area. The distribution of the large landslides has been controlled by tectonics which determined lines of weakness and failure surfaces (passive role) affecting the slopes. On the other hand, tectonics also caused the topographic growth and over-steepening of the slopes (active role) that promoted the occurrence of large landslides. The distribution of large landslides may, therefore, highlight the existence of tectonic processes and it may be used as an indicator of regional-scale tectonic activity, once the geological and geomorphological framework is well constrained.},

We evaluated the performance of a focal approach (based on neighbourhood calculations) using topographic factors for characterizing the gully linear extent and cross-section (XS) morphology (i.e., depth, D, width, W, mean slope, S and width-to-depth ratio, WDR). As for the longitudinal analysis, focal variables (e.g., using the 11 × 11 mean thalweg slope and 75-m downstream mean slope) outperformed the pixel-based approach, with accurate spatial predictions for gully headcuts and mouth locations. The threshold between gullied and non-gullied areas in a slope-area diagram took the form of a break-line rather than a straight limit. For estimating the main XS dimensions (D and W), the Half-width method was applied by selecting the closest point to the thalweg at the gully limits. The tendency to underestimate XS depths was corrected by applying the equations derived from an assessment of the sampling errors in DEMs datasets. The 50 m adjacent slope to the gully was the best explanatory descriptor of both XS dimensions (due to energetic and geometric reasons) along with the channel density, drainage area and total gully length. The XS mean slope and WDR were controlled by the resistance of the materials (investigated through geotechnical and vane-test surveys) where incision processes were dominant (V-shaped XSs in upstream and middle reaches). As sedimentation started to become significant, both morphological parameters changed abruptly and XSs tended to show a trapezoid shape. An adaptative focal strategy with varying window sizes produced better results than the pixel-based approach, requiring larger calculation scopes in areas of greater DEM uncertainty.},

The termination of the mid-late Holocene Hypsithermal, characterised by overall warmer climate with favourable conditions for biogenic productivity, is followed by the regional-scale Neoglacial period, distinctive by the onset of climate deterioration, decreased siliciclastic input, suppressed biogenic (diatom) productivity and low organic content. Based on a principal component analysis, a multi-proxy record provides the precise timing of the Neoglacial onset in the Lake Anónima record at 2050 (2σ: 1990–2130) cal. yrs BP. Applying an adjacent and correlative ice-core (James Ross Island ice cap, r\,=\,0.42), as well as a composite lake sediment (Beak Island, r\,=\,0.49) chronologies, our research provides a refined timing of the Neoglacial onset for the north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula, which is determined to be 2070\,±\,50\,yrs.

Schmidt hammer rebound values in subsurface profiles change gradually from the bedrock surface downward. An exponential relation has been observed between the R-values and depth in rock outcrops to a depth of around 4·5 m. The exponential nature of the curve indicates that rock hardness increases more rapidly with depth in the uppermost 1 m section of the rock profile. A detailed study of rebound values obtained from both intact and polished rock exposures reveal effects of surface grinding on results of the Schmidt hammer method. The range of data collected increases after grinding, allowing more precise discrimination of rock surfaces in respect of age and weathering. The Schmidt hammer method may be used effectively as a relative-age dating tool for rock surfaces that originated during the Late Pleistocene. It is concluded that this time limitation can be significantly mitigated by surface grinding before measurement. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The flysch nappe outliers represent a structural setting prone to the development of deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs). The study area of the Palkovické hůrky hills represents an isolated outlier of the Carpathians flysch nappes, Czech Republic. Geomorphological mapping based on field surveys and interpretation of LiDAR data reveals the occurrence of various types of slope deformations, including two DSGSDs. With the aim of detecting the main controlling factors of the DSGSDs, a multiapproach investigation combining surface and underground studies has been performed. Structural measurement points to a brachysynclinal structure composed of jointed and lithologically diverse strata with step-like topography. High-resolution LiDAR data suggest strong tectonic disruption caused by conjugated transtensional and en echelon tectonic faults controlling the course of slope segments, river valleys and landslide scarps. Four specific localities have been subjected to geophysical surveying. Kilometre-scale electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles that have depths of penetration reaching the limits of the method (N150 m) were acquired across the gravitationally deformed nappe outlier. The data show the overall structural conditions of the nappe outlier consisting of alternating lithological units affected by folds and fault zones. A local subordinate anticline within the central part of the brachysynclinal structure has controlled the origin of the most morphologically pronounced DSGSDs. Other large-scale DSGSDs related to the inherited fault system potentially affect the entire N/NW segment of the studied elevation. Data integration indicate that structural conditions, including lithological boundaries, tectonic disruption and local folding to be the main controlling factors of the DSGSDs evolution.},

  abstract = {Unlike high-relief mountain areas, low-relief hilly landscapes are usually rarely affected by deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs). However, low-topography flysch thrust fronts can create suitable structural conditions for DSGSDs. The study area of the Kavalčanky ridge represents a relatively low-lying ({$<$}120\,m of local relief) DSGSD-affected ridge situated at the thrust front in the flysch Outer Western Carpathians (Czech Republic). With the aim of revealing the main controlling factors and temporal constraints of mass-movement activity, a multidisciplinary investigation of DSGSDs was performed. Typical DSGSD landforms were mapped using high-resolution LiDAR-based mapping. Structural analysis revealed the presence of specific flysch thrust structural conditions with competent sandstone units overthrusted on a weak tectonically disrupted claystone basement. Geophysical measurement with the use of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and ground penetrating radar (GPR) profiling confirmed the deep reach ({$>$}50\,m) of the studied DSGSD. Together with slope stability finite element modelling, geophysics suggests that the shear zone of DSGSDs is represented by one of the thrust faults, whereas lateral limits are formed by a set of conjugate strike-slip faults. Radiocarbon dating of bogs within the DSGSD body showed two phases of mass-movement activity corresponding to the Late Glacial-Holocene transition and Middle Holocene. The recent activity was excluded by dendrogeomorphic analysis. We concluded that the structural conditions involving high lithological complexity, tectonic weakening and the presence of major tectonic contacts might create conditions prone to DSGSDs even in relatively low-topography settings with mass movement activity, especially during humid and warmer Late Quaternary periods.},

  abstract = {Repeat observations underpin our understanding of environmental processes, but financial constraints often limit scientists’ ability to deploy dense networks of conventional commercial instrumentation. Rapid growth in the Internet-Of-Things (IoT) and the maker movement is paving the way for low-cost electronic sensors to transform global environmental monitoring. Accessible and inexpensive sensor construction is also fostering exciting opportunities for citizen science and participatory research. Drawing on 6 years of developmental work with Arduino-based open-source hardware and software, extensive laboratory and field testing, and incorporation of such technology into active research programmes, we outline a series of successes, failures and lessons learned in designing and deploying environmental sensors. Six case studies are presented: a water table depth probe, air and water quality sensors, multi-parameter weather stations, a time-sequencing lake sediment trap, and a sonic anemometer for monitoring sand transport. Schematics, code and purchasing guidance to reproduce our sensors are described in the paper, with detailed build instructions hosted on our King’s College London Geography Environmental Sensors Github repository and the FreeStation project website. We show in each case study that manual design and construction can produce research-grade scientific instrumentation (mean bias error for calibrated sensors –0.04 to 23\%) for a fraction of the conventional cost, provided rigorous, sensor-specific calibration and field testing is conducted. In sharing our collective experiences with build-it-yourself environmental monitoring, we intend for this paper to act as a catalyst for physical geographers and the wider environmental science community to begin incorporating low-cost sensor development into their research activities. The capacity to deploy denser sensor networks should ultimately lead to superior environmental monitoring at the local to global scales.},

  abstract = {This study analyses the behaviour and mobility of major and some trace elements during the physical and chemical development of landslide-prone soil profiles in Limbe, SW Cameroon. The soils result from in situ weathering of Tertiary basaltic and picrobasaltic rocks. Textural and chemical characterisations, together with two mass balance models are applied to understand the mobility and redistribution of elements during the weathering of pyroclastic cones and lava flows. Weathering indices are used to estimate the extent of weathering. The chemical composition of the samples is evaluated by Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP–OES) and their mineralogical composition by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses. It is observed that intensive weathering results in thick meta-stable soils in which significant loss of Ca, K, Mg, Na and Sr has taken place. There is a noticeable relative enrichment in all analysed trace elements (Ba, Zr, Y, Sc, V, Ni, and Co). Ti, Fe, Al, Mn, P and Ce tend to be leached in some horizons and concentrated in others. Zr, Ti, and Ce concentrations are greater in the soils than in the bedrock but show slight fluctuations in the soil and saprolites hence cannot be used as immobile elements for mass balance evaluations. Y increases progressively with advanced weathering. Major secondary mineral phases developed through weathering are a mixture of expanding (smectites) and non-expanding clays (kaolinite, halloysite and mica). The profiles show the presence of textural heterogeneities that can be exploited as slip surfaces. Data plotted in Si–Al–Fe diagram point out that the most advanced stage of weathering noted in these profiles is the kaolinisation stage.},

  abstract = {The Three Gorges region of central western China is one of the most landslide-prone regions in the world. However, landslide detection based on field surveys and optical remote sensing and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques remains difficult owing to the dense vegetation cover and mountain shadow. In the present study, an area of Zigui County in the Three Gorges region was selected to test the feasibility of detecting landslides by employing novel features extracted from a LiDAR-derived DTM. Additionally, two small sites—Site 1 and Site 2 —were selected for training and were used to classify each other. In addition to the aspect, DTM, and slope images, the following feature sets were proposed to improve the accuracy of landslide detection: (1) the mean aspect, DTM, and slope textures based on four texture directions; (2) aspect, DTM, and slope textures based on aspect; and (3) the moving average and standard deviation (stdev) filter of aspect, DTM, and slope. By combining a feature selection method and the RF algorithm, the classification accuracy was evaluated and landslide boundaries were determined. The results can be summarized as follows. (1) The feature selection method demonstrated that the proposed features provided information useful for effective landslide identification. (2) Feature selection achieved an improvement of about 0.44\% in the overall classification accuracy, with the feature set reduced by 74\%, from 39 to 10; this can speed up the training of the RF model. (3) When fifty randomly selected 20\% of landslide pixels (PLS) and 20\% of non-landslide pixels (PNLS) (i.e., 20\% of PLS and PNLS) were utilized in addition to the selected feature subsets for training, the test sets (i.e., the remaining 80\% of PLS and PNLS) yielded an average overall classification accuracy of 78.24\%. The cross training and classification for Site 1 and Site 2 provided overall classification accuracies of 62.65\% and 64.50\%, respectively. This shows that the random sampling design (which suffered some of the effects of spatial auto-correlation) and the proposed method in this present study contribute jointly to the classification accuracy. (4) Using the Canny operator to delineate landslide boundaries based on the classification results of PLS and PNLS, we obtained results consistent with the referenced landslide inventory maps. Thus, the proposed procedure, which combines LiDAR data, a feature selection method, and the RF algorithm, can identify forested landslides effectively in the Three Gorges region.},

  abstract = {Landuse/landcover change detection using remotely sensed images has been widely investigated. Most applications of this type involve either image differencing or image classification using multi-temporal images. If multi-temporal images are to be used for quantitative analysis based on their radiometric information, as in the case of change detection or landuse classification, geometric rectification and radiometric correction must be performed priori to subsequent image analyses. In particular, geometric rectification has significant effect on the accuracy of landuse change detection in areas of rugged terrain. Remote sensing image rectification is commonly done by applying a polynomial trend mapping (PTM) model to image coordinates and map coordinates of groundcontrol-points. A major drawback of the PTM model is that it does not capture the random characteristics of terrain elevation. In this study an ordinary kriging approach is applied for image-to-image registration. The approach considers residuals of the PTM model as anisotropic random fields and employs the ordinary kriging method for spatial interpolation of the residual random fields. Band-ratioing technique was also employed for relative radiometric normalization. From the grey-level histograms of pre- and postevent band-ratio images, we determined the percentage of landuse changes in the study area. Image differencing was then performed using the pre- and post-event band-ratio image pair. Finally, a grey-level threshold of the band-ratio difference image is determined as the value whose exceeding probability equals the areal percentage of landuse change. DTM data of the study area were also used to further restrict landslide areas to steep slope areas.},

One of their conclusions is that in addition to the peak strength of the slope material, the initial slope angle is another factor that controls the amount of material available for landslides, thus the size, of the resultant landslide. It means that in steeper slopes, more material disintegrates for a given material strength, and consequently the produced landslide is larger. However, in our studies based on limit equilibrium simulations, the sliding mass volume decreases with the increasing slope angle for a given material strength, just contrary to the result of Katz et al. One possible explanation is that when the slope angle in our model increases, the geometry of the potential critical slip surface changes, leading to a decrease of the amount of material available for potential sliding that compensates the increasing gravity effect owing to the enlargement of the slope angle. It suggests that there exist different controls of the slope angle on the landslide size for given material strength.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the results of a rockfall hazard assessment for the village of San Quirico (Abruzzo region, Italy) based on an engineering-geological model. After the collection of geological, geomechanical, and geomorphological data, the rockfall hazard assessment was performed based on two separate approaches: i) simulation of detachment of rock blocks and their downhill movement using a GIS; and ii) application of geostatistical techniques to the analysis of georeferenced observations of previously fallen blocks, in order to assess the probability of arrival of blocks due to potential future collapses. The results show that the trajectographic analysis is significantly influenced by the input parameters, with particular reference to the coefficients of restitution values. In order to solve this problem, the model was calibrated based on repeated field observations. The geostatistical approach is useful because it gives the best estimation of point-source phenomena such as rockfalls; however, the sensitivity of results to basic assumptions, e.g. assessment of variograms and choice of a threshold value, may be problematic. Consequently, interpolations derived from different variograms have been used and compared among them; hence, those showing the lowest errors were adopted. The data sets which were statistically analysed are relevant to both kinetic energy and surveyed rock blocks in the accumulation area. The obtained maps highlight areas susceptible to rock block arrivals, and show that the area accommodating the new settlement of S. Quirico Village has the highest level of hazard according to both probabilistic and deterministic methods.},

The MRC that preceded the rockslide-avalanches in the Akaishi Mountains was characterized by a slow but steady downslope bowing of steeply dipping foliations, which accompanied intensive deformation and fragmentation of the rock mass by shearing along foliations. This deformation and fragmentation of the rock mass provides a basic cause for the occurrence of rockslideavalanches, which occur when a creeping rock mass has lost its support from the lower part of a slope by stream erosion. This type of MRC continues for a long time after a part of the creeping area has slid and results in longterm generation of debris by the landslide scar of the rockslide-avalanche.},

The gravitational deformation of shale and sandstone is characterized by disintegration and brecciation of sediments and the formation of pulverized zones with poorly developed planar structures, jigsaw-like structures, and fracture openings. Shear zones are distributed intermittently within the slope but have not merged discernably into a through-going master sliding surface. Incipient landslide shear zones form openings within coherent rock by shearing along bedding, with these shear zones potentially developing downward in a stepwise manner, which may be related to stress redistribution induced by river incision.},

  abstract = {Chigira, M., 1992. Long-term gravitational deformation of rocks by mass rock creep. Eng. Geol., 32: 157-184. Subsurface rocks beneath slopes are deformed to various degrees in various ways by mass rock creep (MRC), when they are subjected to a gravitationally unstable state for a long period. MRC forms folds, faults and numerous kinds of fractures; such deformation is one of the main factors for deteriorating rock masses on slopes and also precursors of many landslides. MRC deformations, which have often been ascribed to tectonic origins, can be distinguished from tectonic ones by their deformational features, landforms and relationships between slope morphology and subsurface structures. MRC folds are flexural-slipfolds that have the following mesoscopic to microscopic characteristics: their axial surfaces are not smooth but are jagged and many visibleopenings or open fractures develop in association with the folds. The jagged axial surfaces become smoother at depth and openings decrease in width with increasing overburden at the deformation site. Macroscopic types of MRC folds change according to the relationship between foliations and slopes; buckling folds form in consequent slopes, drag folds form in a deeper part of obsequent slopes and bending folds form in slopes with steep-dipping foliations (consequent or obsequent) by downslope bowing of foliations. Shear fractures and tension fractures are the main deformational structures formed by MRC in massive rocks. Among shear fractures, those of listric origin are remarkable. Tension fractures, in general, occur either in networks, dividing rocks into fragments that slip and rotate irregularly in relation to each other, or in parallel arrays of steeply dipping fractures.},

  abstract = {Typhoon Talas crossed the Japanese Islands between 2 and 5 September 2011, causing more than 70 deep-seated catastrophic landslides in a Jurassic to Paleogene–lower Miocene accretion complex. Detailed examination of the topographic features of 10 large landslides before the event, recorded on 1-m DEMs based on airborne laser scanner surveys, showed that all landslides had small scarps near their future crowns prior to the slide, and one landslide had linear depressions along its future crown as precursor topographic features. These scarps and linear depressions were caused by gravitational slope deformation that preceded the catastrophic failure. Although the scarps may have been enlarged by degradation, their sizes relative to the whole slopes suggest that minimal slope deformation had occurred in the period immediately before the catastrophic failure. The scarp ratio, defined as the ratio of length of a scarp to that of the whole slope both measured along the slope line, ranged from 5\% to 21\%. Careful examination of aerial photographs from another four large landslides, for which no high-resolution DEMs were available, suggested that they also developed scarps at their heads beforehand. Twelve of the 14 landslides we surveyed in the field had sliding surfaces with wedge-shaped discontinuities that consisted of faults and bedding, suggesting that the buildup of pore pressure occurs readily on wedgeshaped discontinuities in a gravitationally deformed rock body. Most of the faults were undulatory and were probably thrust faults that formed during accretion. Other types of gravitational deformation were also active; e.g., flexural toppling and buckling were observed to have preceded one landslide.},

  abstract = {A new method was designed and used for determining the half-life of the isotope 10Be. The method is based on (1) accurate 10Be/9Be measurements of 9Be-spiked solutions of a 10Be-rich master solution using multicollector ICP mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) and (2) liquid scintillation counting (LSC) using the CIEMAT/NIST method for determining the activity concentrations of the solutions whose 10Be concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry. Important requirements for the success of this approach (a) was the previous coating of glass ampoules filled for counting experiments with 9Be, thereby reducing the risk of the adsorptive loss of 10Be; (b) the removal of Boron from solutions to be measured by MC-ICP-MS by cation chromatography without the introduction of mass fractionation and (c) the accurate determination of the mass bias of 10Be/9Be measurements by ICP-MS which are always affected by the space-charge effect. The mass bias factor was determined to be 1.1862 ± 0.071 for 10Be/9Be from careful fitting and error propagation of ratios of measured Li, B, Si, Cr, Fe, Cu, Sr, Nd, Hf, Tl and U standard solutions of known composition under the same measurement conditions. Employing this factor, an absolute 10Be/9Be ratio of 1.464 ± 0.014 was determined for a first dilution of the 10Be-rich master solution. This solution is now available as an absolute Be ratio standard in AMS measurements. Finally, a half-life of (1.386 ± 0.016) My (standard uncertainty) was calculated. This value is much more precise than previous estimates and was derived from a fully independent set of experiments. In a parallel, fully independent study using the same master solution, Korschinek et al. [35] have determined a half-life of (1.388 ± 0.018) My. The combined half-life and uncertainty amounts to (1.387 ± 0.012) My. We suggest the use of this value in nuclear studies and in studies that make use of cosmogenic 10Be in environmental and geologic samples. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Parameters from the field and laboratory tests of the project are used in the analysis of the shiplock slope. Comparisons between the DEM results and the field measurements under the excavation unloading process are made and the good agreement obtained demonstrates the effectiveness of the DEM for predicting the deformation process of the slope.

  abstract = {Mount Geyikdağ in the Taurus Mountain Range in southern Turkey was glaciated during the Late Pleistocene. Several glacial and periglacial landforms such as moraines and rock glaciers are present in Mount Geyikdağ. Here we described two geomorphic units, a well-preserved moraine loop (so called Zor Moraine) and a rock glacier inside that loop, which have contrasting morpho-stratigraphic positions and terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) 36Cl inventories. We measured 4 samples from each landform. The boulders of Zor Moraine have ages that range from 3.7 ± 0.3 ka to 7.8 ± 0.6 ka with a weighted average age of 5.5 ± 1.2 ka. This age agrees well with the Mid-Holocene glaciation observed within the same range. On the contrary, the boulders of the rock glacier have much older ages. They are in between 9.7 ± 0.9 ka and 14.2 ± 1.1 ka with a weighted average age of 12.5 ± 1.3 ka. We attribute this unlikely situation to excessive inheritance within the rock glacier boulders. On the contrary, Zor Moraine boulders contain no to negligible amount of inheritance, as glacial carving is a very efficient mechanism in removing pre-exposure component. Our study indicates that caution should be taken into account when interpreting the apparent age of a landform as boulders from different landforms might have considerably different prior exposure histories even within a closely related glacial/periglacial environment. It is possible that rock glacier boulder TCN results can yield seemingly maximum ages related to pre-exposure problems. Therefore an independent verification of rock glaciers’ age by other dating methods is advised.},

  abstract = {Bedrock fracturing and rock strength are widely believed to influence landscape morphology and erosional resistance. Yet, understanding of the quantitative relationship between rock-mass strength and landscape evolution remains limited. Here we present a new application of seismic refraction surveys that uses variations in seismic velocity to interpret differences in bedrock fracture density with depth. We use a comparative study of Fiordland and the western Southern Alps of New Zealand to examine how differences in rock type and bedrock fracturing influence landscape morphology and landslide response to rock uplift. In both regions, slopes appear invariant with differential rock-uplift rates and slope distributions reveal modal hillslope angles of \textasciitilde{} 32°. The majority of landslides initiate on slopes steeper than the modal hillslope angle, however, landslide magnitude–frequency distributions reveal order-of-magnitude differences between the regions, with Fiordland experiencing considerably smaller and less frequent landsliding events. Landslide-driven denudation rates of \textasciitilde{} 9 mm/yr in the western Southern Alps and between \textasciitilde{} 0.1 and 0.3 mm/yr in Fiordland approximate estimates of long-term rock-uplift rates for each region. The invariance of hillslope angles, near-normal slope distributions, predominance of landslide initiation on slopes steeper than modal values, and the apparent balance between rates of uplift and landslide-driven erosion suggest that hillslopes in both regions are at threshold angles. Their similar modal slopes further suggest that both ranges are characterized by equivalent rock-mass strength, despite striking differences in lithology. Additionally, our seismic analysis reveals nearly identical surface p-wave velocities. The unexpected equivalence of both modal slopes and surface velocities between these lithologically distinct ranges is attributed to contrasting degrees of surface fracturing that have differentially affected the intact rock properties, such that they now yield equivalent surface velocities and hillslope-scale strengths. Given that surface fractures help regulate threshold angles by modulating hillslope strength; we propose that shallow seismic velocities may provide a quantitative proxy for rock-mass strength. We define two contrasting fracture and landsliding environments. In Fiordland, dense geomorphic fracturing that is focused within the shallow subsurface appears to limit the depth and magnitude of most bedrock landslides. Conversely, in the western Southern Alps, tectonic forces produce pervasive fracturing with depth that results in larger, and deeper landslides. Our data suggest that bedrock fracturing at the Earth's surface modulates threshold hillslope angles, whereas the depth of bedrock fracturing influences the magnitude and frequency of landslide response to tectonic rock uplift.},

  abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a powerlaw distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

  abstract = {A railroad crosses the coastal Gascons rockslide, in Quebec, Canada. This study improves the understanding of the rockslide’s failure mechanism and post-failure behaviour responsible for the deformation in the railroad. The slide is an asymmetrical wedge failure of 410,000 m3, in rocks made up of centimetrescale beds of nodular calcilutite alternating with sandstones and limestone. The post-failure stage of the rockslide is characterised by continuous movement of blocks with speeds ranging from 6 to 110 mm/year. The main water table is just below the sliding surface, but precipitation and snowmelt can raise it above the sliding surface in the upper part of the slide. We propose a model for the rockslide, its failure mechanism, geometry and hydrogeology to provide a baseline for interpreting the near-real-time data collected since 2009.},

  abstract = {Cosmogenic isotope analysis involves the measurement of cosmogenic nuclides that have accumulated in the upper few metres of the Earth’s surface as a result of interactions between cosmic rays and target elements. The concentrations of these cosmogenic nuclides can provide quantitative estimates of the timing and rate of geomorphic processes. In dating applications the concentration of cosmogenic nuclides is interpreted as reflecting the time elapsed since a surface exposure event. However, over most of the Earth’s surface for most of the time the landsurface experiences incremental denudation and in these circumstances cosmogenic nuclide concentrations are related to the rate of denudation. Applications of event dating using cosmogenic isotopes include constructional landforms such as volcanic and depositional features, fault displacement, meteorite impacts, rapid mass movement, bedrock surfaces rapidly eroded by fluvial or wave action or exposed by glacial retreat, and the burial of sediment or ice. Strategies for quantifying rates of incremental change include estimates of denudation rates from site-specific samples and from fluvial sediment samples reflecting catchment-wide rates, and measurements of cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in soils and regolith to quantify rates of rock weathering. The past decade has seen a rapid growth in applications of cosmogenic isotope analysis to a wide range of geomorphological problems, and the technique is now playing a major role in dating and quantifying rates of landscape change over timescales of several thousands to several millions of years.},

  abstract = {Geological structures precondition hillslope stability as well as the processes and landslide mechanisms which develop in response to deglaciation. In areas experiencing glacier retreat and debuttressing, identifying landslide preconditions is fundamental for anticipating landslide development. Herein, the \textasciitilde{} 150 M m3 Mueller Rockslide in Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand, is described; and we document how preconditions have controlled its morphology and development in response to thinning of the adjacent Mueller Glacier. A combination of geomorphological and geotechnical mapping—based on field, geophysical and remote sensing data—was used to characterise the rock mass and morphology of the rockslide and surrounding hillslope. Mueller Rockslide is identified as a rock compound slide, undergoing dominantly translational failure on a dip slope. The crown of the rockslide is bounded by several discontinuous, stepped scarps whose orientation is controlled by joint sets; these scarps form a zone of toppling that is delivering rock debris to the main rockslide body. Surface and subsurface discontinuity mapping above the crown identified numerous joints, fractures and several scarps that may facilitate continued retrogressive enlargement of the rockslide. The presence of lateral release structures, debuttressing of the rockslide toe and steeply dipping bedding suggest that the rockslide may be capable of evolving to a rapid failure.},

Proceedings of the Geologists' Association, 119, 259-276. The Brecon Beacons represent the most southerly area subject to marginal glaciation during the Younger Dryas/Loch Lomond Stadial in the British Isles and the interpretation of upland landforms in this area therefore has particular palaeo-environmental significance. This study reports geomorphological evidence within two trough-heads in the central Brecon Beacons previously thought to reflect Younger Dryas glaciation. A complex suite of landforms is identified at both sites, reflecting a range of environmental processes dating from throughout the Lateglacial period. Possible Younger Dryas terminal and recessional moraines are identified at each site, consisting of passively and actively transported debris, which have subsequently undergone considerable paraglacial modification. A number of other non-glacial landforms and sediments are identified, including a protalus/pronival rampart. The initial interpretations are tested using a glaciological approach of reconstructing former glacier dynamics, and suggests that some of the terminal moraines observed reflect mountain glaciation prior to the Younger Dryas, and may demonstrate final stages of retreat from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). A morphostratigraphic sequence for both sites is reconstructed, reflecting landscape evolution in a range of environments from final LGM deglaciation through to Holocene landscape stability. It is concluded that associations of such landforms may be common in marginal areas of former glaciation, and that interpretations of former niche/cirque glaciation should be supported by the reconstruction of probable mass-balance, glacier dynamics and palaeoclimatic implications to improve on geomorphological speculation.},

  abstract = {This paper is addressed to readers without advanced knowledge of remote sensing. It illustrates some current and potential uses of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) for landslide assessment. Data acquired by SAR systems can provide 3D terrain models and be used to assist in regional scale investigations, e.g. aimed at evaluation of susceptibility of slopes to failure. Under favourable environmental conditions, the innovative Permanent Scatterers (PS) technique, which overcomes several limitations of conventional SAR differential interferometry (DInSAR) applications in landslide studies, is suitable for monitoring slope deformations with millimetric precision. The PS technique combines the wide-area coverage typical of satellite imagery with the capability of providing displacement data relative to individual image pixels. With the currently available radar satellites, however, only very slow ground surface displacements can be reliably detected and measured. The presented case study of a landslide from the Liechtenstein Alps indicates that the most attractive and reliable contribution provided by this remote sensing technique lies in the possibility of (i.) wide-area qualitative distinction between stable and unstable areas and (ii.) qualitative (relative) hazard zonation of large, slow landslides based on the identification of segments characterised by different movement rates. Since only the radar line of sight projection of the displacements can be detected, a quantitative exploitation of the PS data is possible only where sufficient ground truth is available. In site specific or single landslide investigations the PS data can represent a very useful complementary data source with respect to the information acquired through ground based observations and in situ surveying. However, the difficulties associated with the feasibility assessments of the applicability of SAR data to local scale problems, as well as with the interpretation of PS results, require a close collaboration between landslide experts and specialists in advanced processing of radar satellite data. The interpretation of the exact geotechnical significance of small, radar sensed ground surface deformations is challenging, especially where ground truth is lacking. Although any ground deformation is potentially of interest to an engineering geologist, detection of movements in both vertical and horizontal directions is needed in the case of landslides to evaluate slope failure mechanisms. With their high radar viewing angles, however, the current space-borne systems can detect only a fraction of the horizontal component of movement. It is expected that the upcoming SAR dedicated missions with new sensors and different acquisition geometries, combined with the rapid developments in the field of advanced radar data processing, will allow a full 3D reconstruction of deformation data and help to further reduce the current limitations of the PS and similar DInSAR approaches.},

  abstract = {Water isotopes are an important tool for reconstructing the amount of atmospheric lifting related to high topography in the geologic past. However, our capacity for meaningful interpretation requires understanding the climatic setting and isolating the influence of orography on water isotopes. Patagonia's simple, steady climatology and location within the Southern Westerlies makes it an ideal setting for successful application of water isotopes to measuring topography through time. Here we use hydrated volcanic glass to construct a new record of the size of the Patagonian Andes during the Cenozoic. We also utilize a novel method for identifying the contribution of orography in regional climate records. Our results show that variation in the observed record can largely be explained by variations in climate. Thus we conclude that the mountain range has maintained a size similar to modern since at least Paleocene. This result is in agreement with geologic data, which constrain the bulk of the surface uplift of the Andes to the Cretaceous. The reconstruction of the Patagonian Andes, which grew in the Cretaceous and remained high through the Cenozoic, is markedly different from the widely held view of Miocene formation of this mountain range. In particular, the topography appears to remain stable during the northward propagation and collision of offshore spreading centers.},

  abstract = {During the Late Weichselian deglaciation, the coastal mountains of northern central Iceland have experienced significant paraglacial readjustment processes in the form of conspicuous rock slope failures and deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD). Local topographic slopes and ridges were deeply reshaped by these large scale paraglacial processes. Located on the eastern side of Skagafjo€rður, one of the largest fjords of northern Iceland, the O  slandshlíðarfjo€ll and Hnjúkar ridges (65 49N, 19 14W) exhibit geomorphic evidence of spectacular DSGDS. Several series of DSGSD-induced landforms such as crestal graben and troughs initiated by ridge-top splitting were investigated over a 30-km2 area. On the basis of geomorphological mapping we recognized: (i) a ridge-top splitting event mainly controlled by glacial debuttressing induced by a minimal 300 m lowering of the glacier surface in the Deildardalur valley; (ii) a rapid Late Weichselian deglaciation of the Deildardalur valley spanning a few thousands of years (ice-free stage probably reached around 14,000 years cal. BP); (iii) ridge-top splitting having an influence on large-scale glacial patterns by guiding and facilitating glacial erosion along ridge-top grabens, resulting in accelerated trough widening. Based on these interpretations, we propose an evolutionary sequence of both the kinematic stages of the DSGSD and the Late Weichselian deglaciation at the valley scale. This work provides new insights into (i) the patterns of the Late Weichselian deglaciation in the Skagafjo€rður area, especially in tributary valleys of the fjord, (ii) the timing of large-scale paraglacial ridge-top deformations in relation to the post-LGM deglaciation and (iii) the influence of paraglacial DSGSD features on large-scale glacial erosional patterns.},

  abstract = {The probability of occurrence is one of the key components of the risk equation. To assess this probability in landslide risk analysis, two different approaches have been traditionally used. In the first one, the occurrence of landslides is obtained by computing the probability of failure of a slope (or the reactivation of existing landslides). In the second one, which is the objective of this paper, the probability is obtained by means of the statistical analysis of past landslide events, specifically by the assessment of the past landslide frequency. In its turn, the temporal frequency of landslides may be determined based on the occurrence of landslides or from the recurrence of the landslide triggering events over a regional extent. Hazard assessment using frequency of landslides, which may be taken either individually or collectively, requires complete records of landslide events, which is difficult in some areas. Its main advantage is that it may be easily implemented for zoning. Frequency assessed from the recurrence of landslide triggers, does not require landslide series but it is necessary to establish reliable relations between the trigger, its magnitude and the occurrence of the landslides. The frequency of the landslide triggers can be directly used for landslide zoning. However, because it does not provide information on the spatial distribution of the potential landslides, it has to be combined with landslide susceptibility (spatial probability analysis) to perform landslide hazard zoning. Both the scale of work and availability of data affect the results of the landslide frequency and restrict the spatial resolution of frequency zoning as well. Magnitude–frequency relationships are fundamental elements for the quantitative assessment of both hazard and risk.},

  abstract = {Trees affected by mass movements record the evidence of geomorphic disturbance in their growth-ring series, and thereby provide a precise geochronological tool for the reconstruction of past process activity. At the tree scale, identification of past mass movements was typically based on the presence of growth anomalies and focused on the presence of scars, tilted or buried trunks, as well as on apex decapitation. In terms of sampling strategy, however, clear guidelines have been largely missing. Most previous work was based either on the sampling of visibly disturbed trees irrespective of their position at the study site or on the systematic sampling of trees evenly distributed along transects. Based on a dense dataset of 323 trees growing on an active landslide body, this study aims at defining guidelines for future tree-ring sampling of landslides. Using random extractions of trees and iterative mapping, we investigate subsets of the full tree-ring sample to define optimal sampling strategy, sample depth and trees for the development of frequency maps of landslide reactivations. We demonstrate that (i) the sampling of 50 e100 trees can be sufficient to obtain satisfactory results on landslide frequency without including noise to the dendrogeomorphic record; (ii) increasing growth disturbance thresholds should be adjusted to sample size and are preferable to fixed values; (iii) an even distribution of sampled trees is crucial to increase the reliability of frequency maps, even more so if the reconstruction is based on small sample sizes; and that (iv) the selection of the most frequently disturbed trees is key to reduce uncertainties in the frequency maps. The optimization of sample sizes and the adjustment of sampling strategy will not only facilitate fieldwork and render analyses and interpretation more reliable, but will also ultimately allow reconstruction of time series of past mass movements with reasonable temporal efforts and excellent cost-benefit ratios.},

  abstract = {In de-glaciated areas, para-glaciation (i.e. the conditioning of landscapes by prior glaciation) has often been considered a major predisposing factor in landslide occurrence; its consequences have been particularly well identified at a fine scale (especially on bedrock jointing). Hitherto, the relative impacts of para-glaciation on hillslope dynamics at a regional scale had nevertheless not been quantified statistically. We examine Skagafjörður area (northern Iceland) where landslides are widespread (at least 108 were mapped in an area of c. 3000 km2). We compare the role of para-glaciation (debuttressing, influence of post-glacial rebound) with that of classic factors (topography, lithology, etc.) in landslide occurrence and location, using a spatial analysis based on a chi-square test. On the one hand, the results highlight that landslides are over-represented in areas where post-glacial rebound was at its maximum, with a stronger concentration of landslides in the northern part of the fjord. On the other hand, the distribution of landslides did not show any clear relationship with the pattern of glacial debuttressing. Tschuprow coefficient highlights that the influence of post-glacial rebound on landslide location is higher than the combined influence of slope gradient, curvature or geological structure. This result is supported by our initial evidence for the timing of landslides in the area: most landslides occurred during the first half of the Holocene, and a period of hillslope instability was initiated when the post-glacial uplift was at its maximum. Finally, the mechanisms that link post-glacial rebound and landsliding as well as the geomorphic impacts of landslides, are discussed. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The Upper Durance catchment is an area prone to rock-slope failures. Such failures reflect the combination of high relief, lithostructural controls and paraglacial stress release. The aim of this study is to determine the role of deglacial unloading and resulting paraglacial stress release in conditioning or triggering slope failure. Former dimensions of the Durance glacier are reconstructed, then combined with Digital Elevation Model data in a raster Geographic Information System to quantify the spatial pattern of stresses associated with glacial loading at the Last Glacial Maximum. Preliminary calculations suggest that major rock falls and rock avalanches are associated with areas subject to the highest decompression stresses. Focus on two case studies allows the consequences of paraglacial stress release on slope instability to be evaluated. Description of slope failure runout deposits allows reconstruction of the nature of slope failure. Surface exposure dates based on concentration of cosmogenic 10Be allows the timing of both deglaciation and that of post-glacial rock-slope failures to be established. It is shown that rock-slope failures are concentrated on lower valley-side slopes within the area occupied by ice at the Last Glacial Maximum, and that their locations coincide with zones of inferred high glacial loading stress, consistent with interpretation of both bedrock disruption and large-scale rock-slope failures as paraglacial phenomena induced by stress release following deglaciation. Timing of initial rock avalanche runout deposition at one site is consistent with this conclusion, though later instability episodes at the same site may have occurred independent of the influence of paraglacial stress release.},

  abstract = {Of the numerous kinds of dams that form by natural processes, dams formed from landslides, glacial ice, and late-neoglacial moraines present the greatest threat to people and property. Landslide dams form in a wide range of physiographic settings. The most common types of mass movements that form landslide dams are rock and debris avalanches; rock and soil slumps and slides; and mud, debris, and earth flows. The most common initiation mechanisms for dam-forming landslides are excessive rainfall and snowmelt and earthquakes. Landslide dams can be classified into six categories based on their relation with the valley floor. Type I dams (11\% of 184 landslide dams from around the world that we were able to classify) do not reach from one valley side to the other. Type II dams (44\%) span the entire valley floor, in some cases depositing material high on opposite valley sides. Type III dams (41\%) move considerable distances both upstream and downstream from the landslide failure. Type IV dams ({$<$}1\%) are rare and involve the contemporaneous failure of material from both sides of a valley. Type V dams ({$<$}1\%) also are rare and are created when a single landslide sends multiple tongues of debris into a valley and forms two or more landslide dams in the same reach of river. Type VI dams (3\%) involve one or more failure surfaces that extend under the stream or valley and emerge on the opposite valley side. Many landslide dams fail shortly after formation. In our sample of 73 documented landslide-dam failures, 27\% of the landslide dams failed less than 1 day after formation, and about 50\% failed within 10 days. Over-topping is by far the most common cause of failure. The timing of failure and the magnitude of the resulting floods are controlled by dam size and geometry; material characteristics of the blockage; rate of inflow to the impoundment; size and depth of the impoundment; bedrock control of flow; and engineering controls such as artificial spill-ways, diversions, tunnels, and planned breaching by blasting or conventional excavation. Glacial-ice dams can produce at least nine kinds of ice-dammed lakes. The most dangerous are lakes formed in main valleys dammed by tributary glaciers. Failure can occur by erosion of a drainage tunnel under or through the ice dam or by a channel over the ice dam. Cold polar-ice dams generally drain supraglacially or marginally by downmelting of an outlet channel. Warmer, temperate-ice dams tend to fail by sudden englacial or subglacial breaching and drainage. Late-neoglacial moraine-dammed lakes are located in steep mountain areas affected by the advances and retreats of valley glaciers in the last several centuries. These late-neoglacial dams pose hazards because (1) they are sufficiently young that vegetation has not stabilized their slopes, (2) many dam faces are steeper than the angle of repose, (3) these dams and lakes are immediately downslope from steep crevassed glaciers and near-vertical rock slopes, and (4) downstream from these dams are steep canyons with easily erodible materials that can be incorporated in the flow and increase flood peaks. The most common reported failure mechanism is overtopping and breaching by a wave or series of waves in the lake generated by icefalls, rockfalls, or snow or rock avalanches. Melting of ice cores or frozen ground and piping and seepage are other possible failure mechanisms. Natural dams may cause upstream flooding as the lake rises and downstream flooding as a result of failure of the dam. Although data are few, for the same potential energy at the dam site, ownstream flood peaks from the failure of glacier-ice dams are smaller than those from landslide, moraine, and structed earth-fill and rock-fill dam failures. Moraine-dam failures appear to produce some of the largest downstream flood peaks for potential energy at the dam site greater than 1011-1012 joules. Differences in flood peaks natural-dam failures appear to be controlled by dam characteristics and failure mechanisms.},

Methods for enhancement, manual identification and extraction of lineaments, and estimation of best fit planes representing bedding are presented and evaluated for a study area in folded metasedimentary rocks in northeast Tasmania, Australia. Estimated bedding plane dip directions are shown to be accurate and reliable when compared with field-based observations. The same cannot be said for dip angle estimates. It is likely that small errors in the location of a manually digitized lineament will affect dip estimation more than dip direction estimation, particularly for steeply dipping structures. Fold axis orientations calculated from the stereographic analysis of estimated bedding closely correspond to orientations determined from field data. The mean absolute differences ± standard error for 12 of the 14 regularly spaced domains located within the study area were 8.7◦ ± 1.2◦ for the fold plunge and 4.9◦ ± 0.9◦ for the fold trend. The techniques described here for the extraction of bedding plane orientations from high-resolution DEMs complement field-based geological mapping and can assist structural interpretations.},

  abstract = {Rockslides in alpine areas can reach large volumes and, owing to their position along slopes, can either undergo large and rapid evolution originating large rock avalanches or can decelerate and stabilize. As a consequence, in particular when located within large deep-seated deformations, this type of instability requires accurate observation and monitoring. In this paper, the case study of the La Saxe rockslide (ca. 8 × 106m3), located within a deep-seated deformation, undergoing a major phase of acceleration in the last decade and exposing the valley bottom to a high risk, is discussed. To reach a more complete understanding of the process, in the last 3years, an intense investigation program has been developed. Boreholes have been drilled, logged, and instrumented (open-pipe piezometers, borehole wire extensometers, inclinometric casings) to assess the landslide volume, the rate of displacement at depth, and the water pressure. Displacement monitoring has been undertaken with optical targets, a GPS network, a ground-based interferometer, and four differential multi-parametric borehole probes. A clear seasonal acceleration is observed related to snow melting periods. Deep displacements are clearly localized at specific depths. The analysis of the piezometric and snowmelt data and the calibration of a 1D block model allows the forecast of the expected displacements. To this purpose, a 1D pseudo-dynamic visco-plastic approach, based on Perzyna’s theory, has been developed. The viscous nucleus has been assumed to be bi-linear: in one case, irreversible deformations develop uniquely for positive yield function values; in a more general case, visco-plastic deformations develop even for negative values. The model has been calibrated and subsequently validated on a long temporal series of monitoring data, and it seems reliable for simulating the in situ data. A 3D simplified approach is suggested by subdividing the landslide mass into distinct interacting blocks.},

  abstract = {Editorial Dating, triggering, modelling, and hazard assessment of large landslides Large landslides, including rockslides, rock and debris avalanches, debris flows, and sackung (or slope sags), result from a complex of controlling features and processes (Hutchinson, 1988). Geological history (Ballantyne, 2002), lithology and structure (Zischinsky, 1966, 1969; Benko and Stead, 1998; Agliardi et al., 2001; Gutiérrez-Santolalla et al., 2005; Ambrosi and Crosta, 2006; Hermanns et al., 2006), slope relief and shape (Savage et al., 1985; Savage and Swolfs, 1986; Miller and Dunne, 1996; Martel, 2000; Molnar, 2004), weather and climate (Evans and Clague, 1994; Ballantyne et al., 1998; Ballantyne, 2002), seismicity (Solonenko, 1977; Radbruch-Hall, 1978; Keefer, 1984; Crosta et al., 2005; Chigira and Yagi, 2006; Hippolyte et al., 2006) and human activity (Heim, 1932; Cruden, 1976) are the most important causative factors. Some of the above factors also control the geometry of the failure surface and its development both in space and time. A variety of data, models, and theories have been presented to explain the locations of large slope failures (Carrara, 1983), their geometry, time of occurrence, triggering mechanisms, rates and types of movement (Shreve, 1968; Melosh, 1979; Legros, 2002; Iverson, 2006; McSaveney and Davies, 2006), and their effects, including, for example, landslide damming, increased erosion, and impacts on structure. The associated risk can be high, both to communities and to critical infrastructure in hinterlands (Evans et al., 2006). The risk can extend far from the source slopes, for example due to landslide damming of rivers (Schuster, 2006) and generation of large water waves in lakes and reservoirs (e.g., Vajont, Italy in 1963; Hendron and Patton, 1985; see also examples in Voight, 1978). This special issue of Geomorphology builds on a similar set of papers published in 2006 in Engineering Geology (volume 83, numbers 1–3). The focus of that issue was large landslides, but the papers covered a broad spectrum of subject matter. Similarly, for this special issue of Geomorphology, we have assembled a diverse set of papers, covering such subjects as triggers and causes of large landslides, chronology, modelling, and hazard and risk assessment. In our preface to the earlier Engineering Geology issue (Crosta and Clague, 2006), we listed some of the major aspects of large landslides that we considered to be understudied or controversial: • Regional distribution within mountain ranges; • triggers and causes, including the effects of climatic change; • chronology, including initial movement, reactivation, and recurrence; • failure mechanisms, including conditioning of the failure zone and final collapse; • material behaviour, including internal deformation and transport mechanisms; • style and degree of past and present activity; • new tools for studying landslides and understanding their future evolution; • passive vs. active controls exerted by geological structures; • hydrological conditions; • development of numerical models and codes for simulating triggering and movement, including rapid long runout; • the role of humans in causing failure; • quantitative assessment of hazard and risk; and • appropriate remedial and mitigation measures. These topics still require attention. In each case, progress is possible only by using a multidisciplinary approach involving fields such as geology, geomorphology, geochronology, engineering geology, hydrology, geochemistry, engineering, and geophysics. No single specialty applied alone will significantly advance our understanding of large landslides. Some of the major topics listed above were addressed in the past issue. For example, Ambrosi and Crosta (2006), and Seno and Thuring (2006) documented the regional distribution of large sackung in the central Italian Alps, and Jarman reported similar features in Scotland (Jarman, 2006). Jibson et al. (2006) documented rock avalanches in Alaska triggered by a large earthquake in 2002. Geertsema et al. (2006a,b) and Weidinger (2006) described diverse landslides in, respectively, western Canada and the Himalaya. Several papers in the past issue dealt with constraints imposed on slope stability by different lithologies (Geertsema et al., 2006a,b; Mikos et al., 2006) geomorphol-ogy (Hermanns et al., 2006) and structure (Ambrosi and Crosta, 2006). The papers in this issue differ in scope, type of phenomena, and methodological approach from those in the earlier volume, but they all address one or more of the topics listed above. This issue comprises 13 papers, six dealing with the European Alps, two with the mountains of western North America, three with the Himalaya, and one with the mountains of Taiwan. One of the papers is on 3D physical modeling of large rock mass failures with no specific geographical reference. Ten papers focus on large rockslides and rock avalanches, one on earth-flows, two on sackung. The chronological aspect, including initial movement, reactivation, and recurrence of large rock avalanches and sackung, is addressed in three papers (Agliardi et al., Ivy-Ochs et al., Prager et al.). This is still an important research subject to solve the major questions about the origin of these movements, the more influencing and controlling factors (e.g. glacial debuttressing , rock mass damage and weathering, groundwater changes, climatic changes, tectonic activity), their evolution (i.e. rapid or slow, or by successive pulses) and their present state of activity (especially for deep seated gravitational slope deformations). The recognition of predisposing structural factors and of their role on failure and landslide type is considered in three other papers (Brideau et al., Dunning et al., Jaboyedoff et al.).

  abstract = {Deep seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSD) are widespread phenomena, recognized in different mountain ranges worldwide. The distribution of such phenomena at the scale of a mountain belt has rarely been systematically analysed in the past. Aim of the paper is to present and discuss an inventory map of DSGSD at the scale of the entire European Alps, in order to review existing knowledge and investigate general controls on these phenomena. The criteria adopted for their classification and distinction are presented. A total of 1033 DSGSDs, ranging in size between 0.03 and 108 km2, have been mapped. The inventory has been validated against available local or regional landslide inventories at different scales and prepared by different authors using different approaches. The frequency–area relationship for the mapped features is presented. The spatial distribution of the mapped DSGSD has been quantified by discretizing the study area into regular square grids with different resolution, and analysed with respect to a variety of geological, geomorpohological and morphometric variables, and of their clustering. Discriminant, principal component and cluster analyses have been performed to define the most important controlling and predisposing factors. Results suggest that the occurrence of foliated metamorphic rocks, LGM ice thickness, local relief (and related parameters), slope size, drainage density and river stream power are the local parameters most positively correlated to DSGSD occurrence. The impact of these phenomena on slope morphology, in terms of hypsometry and slope gradient adjustment is also discussed.},

Models based on continuum mechanics and associated with a versatile rheological model are usually preferred to predict landslide runout and relevant parameters. A different approach has been used in this research. We have developed a 2-D/3-D finite element code to analyse slope stability and to model runout of mass movements characterised by very large displacements. The idea was to be able to use different material laws already known, tested and verified for granular materials. The implemented materials laws include classical elasto-plasticity, with a linear elastic part and different applicable yield surfaces with associated and non-associated flow rules. The application of Finite Element methods to model landslide run-out, contrasts previous research where typically depth-averaged equivalent-fluid approaches were adopted. The code has been applied to the simulation of large rock avalanches and rapid dry flows in different materials and under different geological and geomorphological conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The 1987 Val Pola Landslide was the most destructive and costly natural disaster that occurred in Italy during the last two decades. The disaster response and monitoring system, along with related construction activities for this single landslide event amounts to nearly half of the annual landslide prevention budget in Italy. It is also one of the few cases of landslide study for which a large amount of quantitative data have been gathered. The Val Pola landslide thus provides an invaluable benchmark for geotechnical modelling and model calibrations due to its fully three-dimensional features and significant multi-directional impact in space. In this paper, the entire runout process including the reactivation of the landslide has been numerically replayed using a (quasi) three-dimensional finite element method in the Lagrangian reference frame, based on Voellmy rheology and high-precision basal topography available in a GIS database. Comparison between the results of the present analysis and the available field observations is remarkable, demonstrating the capability of the present methodology in tackling large-scale landslides of complex nature. The technique is thus of value in land use zoning and the study of geomorphologic features. It also provides a powerful and handy tool in studying possible scenarios of future landform processes.},

  abstract = {The role and significance that have been ascribed to landsliding within geomorphology were examined with respect to some of the influential historical concepts of landform evolution. Landsliding was almost completely ignored as a geomorphic process in the earliest models of landform evolution. While there has been a growing acknowledgement of landsliding as a hillslope process capable of performing significant erosion and transportation, it has received only sparse recognition as a formative process in its own right. Notable exceptions are the rarely referenced model of relief development of Skempton, A.W., 1953. Soil mechanics in relation to geology. Proceedings of the Yorkshire Geological Society 29 (3), 33–62 Pt.1 and the reply of Selby, M.J., 1974. Dominant geomorphic events in landform evolution. Bulletin International Association of Engineering Geology 9, 85–89 to the frequency–magnitude findings of Wolman, M.G., Miller, J.P., 1960. Magnitude and frequency of forces in geomorphic processes. Journal of Geology 68 (1), 54–74. Together, these two contributions provide a sound basis of geomechanical theory and ample empirical evidence to indicate that landslides have the potential to control landform evolution. It is proposed that landslide geomorphology systems exist, within which landslides dominate form and process by governing the mechanisms, rhythm, and pace of geomorphic change, in time and space. A review of New Zealand terrain suggests that these criteria are met in six distinctive landslide geomorphology systems. Each of these can be characterised not only by the landslide regime but also by the fundamental pre-conditions of tectonic setting and geology. It is argued that the existence of such systems and the complex interrelations involved require the recognition of a landslide geomorphology in its own right.},

  abstract = {Lago Posadas is located at the foot of the Southern Patagonian Andes, in southwestern Argentina, where the early Miocene Santa Cruz Formation (SCF) shows thick and laterally continuous exposures. This region has been scarcely explored for fossil vertebrates since the first efforts by J.B. Hatcher in 1898-99. In this contribution, we performed sedimentologic and paleontological studies in order to reconstruct depositional environments and the associated fossil vertebrate fauna. Sedimentologic data suggest that the sedimentary record begins with restricted marine-estuarine deposits grading upward to fluvial floodplains and fluvial channels. Extensive floodplains, occasionally interrupted by low-sinuosity, sand-dominated channels, show dominant reddish coloration, moderate to low paleosol development, abundant crevasse splay sandstones and lack of vegetal remains, suggesting deposition in a low gradient, oxygenated setting under elevated sedimentation rates. Vertical stratigraphic trends are subtle, suggesting little paleoenvironmental changes during deposition of the whole SCF in this region. Paleocurrent directions, sandstone composition and paleogeographic reconstructions all indicate that deposition of the SCF was strongly associated to the contemporaneous uplift of the Andes. Fossil vertebrates analyzed are the result of our collecting effort and revision of museum collections. The faunal assemblage includes 31 taxa: 28 mammals and three birds. Mammals belong to the main groups recorded in other areas of the SCF (metatherians, xenarthrans, notoungulates, litopterns, astrapotheres and rodents). The assemblage allows a Santacrucian Age sensu lato assignment for the fauna at Lago Posadas. Taxonomic revisions of several taxa are necessary to further adjust the biostratigraphic significance of this association. The combined record of arboreal, browser and frugivores, on one side, and grazer mammals and rheas, on the other, suggest the presence of both trees and open environments. Frugivores, among primary consumers, and the secondary consumers guild are under-represented due to sample and fossil remain size biases. The sedimentologic and paleontological record of the SCF in Lago Posadas suggests that the uplift of the Southern Patagonian Andes acted as a primary control on basin subsidence and sediment supply, providing a special signature for sub-andean localities. However, previously registered climatic changes are poorly recorded in this study.Keywords:~Facies analysis; Paleoecology; Austral Basin; Santacrucian; Burdigalian; Fluvial system},

These deposits, referred as El Chacay (Argentina) or Guadal (Chile) formations, and the transition to the overlying Santa Cruz Formation were divided into seven facies: subtidal sand-bars, shallow marine sandy deposits, muddy shelf deposits, estuarine complex deposits, fluvial channels and fluvial floodplains. These are arranged in a general transgressive-regressive cycle, subdivided into two stratigraphic sequences, separated by a major erosional surface. 87Sr/86Sr ages from shell carbonate in eight oysters yielded an age range of 20.3 to 18.1 Ma for these “Patagoniense” deposits. Correlation with other dated “Patagoniense” sections in southern Patagonia, like those at Lago Argentino or Comodoro Rivadavia, indicates that they belong to a single transgression that flooded several Patagonian basins approximately at the same time. Eustasy, flexural subsidence created by tectonic loading in the adjacent fold-and-thrust belt, and basin floor paleo-topography controlled the duration of the depositional event and the sedimentation style of these shallow marine deposits.},

  abstract = {Modification of Lateglacial and Holocene talus sheets by debris flows and gully incision on Mynydd Du, Wales, has resulted in a convergence of upper slope form characterised by an upper rectilinear slope gradient of 36j F 3j and a range of concavities of c. 0.1 – 0.2. In most cases, gully incision and accumulation of debris cones have led to an increase in slope concavity. Evidence for talus erosion, reworking and redeposition on the upper slope emphasises secondary reworking processes, as well as primary talus accumulation on the upper slope, and permits construction of a model of talus development at Mynydd Du. On the basis of talus volume, calculation of the first rockwall retreat data set for southern Britain suggests that c. 7.1 m (84\%) of overall rockwall retreat (8.5 m) took place during the Lateglacial, and only c. 1.4 m (16\%) occurred during the Holocene. These figures imply that Lateglacial retreat rates ranged from 1.01 to 2.44 m kaÀ 1, with an overall mean rate of 1.23 m kaÀ 1. In contrast, Holocene rockwall retreat rates range from 0.10 to 0.17 m kaÀ 1, with a mean rate of 0.12 m kaÀ 1. Approximately 27\% of cliff retreat is attributed to microgelivation. While similar to Holocene and present-day alpine environments, these Lateglacial retreat rates are one order of magnitude higher than most equivalent values for arctic sites. This reflects both ‘alpine-style’ diurnal freeze – thaw activity on Mynydd Du during the Younger Dryas and paraglacial rock-mass instability following deglaciation. Assuming an exponential decline in rockwall sediment release, it is estimated that approximately half the talus had accumulated within c. 1 ka of deglaciation. At one site, paraglacial talus accumulation appears to have contributed significantly to the glacial sediment transport system of a subsequent ice advance. Present-day rates of rockwall retreat and talus accumulation by rockfall are estimated to be 0.014 and 0.022 mm yrÀ 1 (m kaÀ 1), respectively, similar to values for other British sites and markedly lower than Holocene rates of cliff recession due to microgelivation. By implication, the geomorphic significance of microgelivation may have been greatly underestimated in studies of inland rock-slope evolution in temperate, mid-latitude environments.},

  abstract = {This article presents a reconstruction of Late Holocene vegetation changes within the lower montane forest zone in the Beskid Wyspowy Mountains (Western Carpathians, Central Europe). Pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, loss on ignition, and microscopic charcoal analyses were applied to a profile collected from the deposits of the rich fen which developed in the landslide depression. The results reveal that during the period between ca. 4800 ± 70 and 4160 ± 60 cal. BP, Picea abies dominated in the local forests. Between ca. 4800 ± 70 and 4660 ± 60 cal. BP, Acer was an important component in local woodlands, which distinguishes the study site from others in the Western Carpathians. At ca. 4100 ± 60 cal. BP, forests dominated by Abies alba and Fagus sylvatica expanded. Nowadays, this type of vegetation is characteristic of the lower montane zone in the Polish Western Carpathians. This expansion was probably a consequence of environmental disturbances related to the cold and wet ‘4.2 ka BP’ event. The spread of these forests was preceded by a short episode of expansion of Tilia (Tilia cordata and/or Tilia platyphyllos) which was a very local event. The area of the Beskid Wyspowy Mountains provided suitable habitats for the occurrence of T. baccata, which has not been recorded in pollen data spanning the Middle and beginning of the Late Holocene from this mountain range. A significant increase in the percentages of Kretzschmaria deusta, a parasitic fungus, reveals that A. alba–F. sylvatica forests provided an optimal habitat for such species during the period from 4070 ± 60 to 47 cal. BP. Since ca. 2640 ± 110 cal. BP, pollen of pioneer trees, such as Pinus sylvestris and Betula, as well as human activity indicators (Cerealia type and Plantago lanceolata) have become more frequent. Nonetheless, it is highly probable that this section of deposits also includes the presence of one or more sedimentary gaps.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} We present the results of a reconnaissance investigation of unusual debris mass-movement features on permafrost slopes that pose a potential infrastructure hazard in the south-central Brooks Range, Alaska. For the purpose of this paper, we describe these features as frozen debris-lobes. We focus on the characterisation of frozen debris-lobes as indicators of various movement processes using ground-based surveys, remote sensing, field and laboratory measurements, and time-lapse observations of frozen debris-lobe systems along the Dalton Highway. Currently, some frozen debris-lobes exceed 100 m in width, 20 m in height and 1000 m in length. Our results indicate that frozen debris-lobes have responded to climate change by becoming increasingly active during the last decades, resulting in rapid downslope movement. Movement indicators observed in the field include toppling trees, slumps and scarps, detachment slides, striation marks on frozen sediment slabs, recently buried trees and other vegetation, mudflows, and large cracks in the lobe surface. The type and diversity of observed indicators suggest that the lobes likely consist of a frozen debris core, are subject to creep, and seasonally unfrozen surface sediment is transported in warm seasons by creep, slumping, viscous flow, blockfall and leaching of fines, and in cold seasons by creep and sliding of frozen sediment slabs. Ground-based measurements on one frozen debris-lobe over three years (2008–2010) revealed average movement rates of approximately 1 cm day\textsuperscript{−1}, which is substantially larger than rates measured in historic aerial photography from the 1950s to 1980s. We discuss how climate change may further influence frozen debris-lobe dynamics, potentially accelerating their movement. We highlight the potential direct hazard that one of the studied frozen debris-lobes may pose in the coming years and decades to the nearby Trans Alaska Pipeline System and the Dalton Highway, the main artery for transportation between Interior Alaska and the North Slope.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Calcareous tufas are great archives of geochemical information for the reconstruction of past climate. Their importance increases in the regions where other proxies are rare, such as Western Carpathians. Here, we present the first whole-Holocene palaeoclimatic reconstruction for this region based on geochemical proxies. We analysed δ18O, δ13C and Mg/Ca ratio on tufa calcite of the Mituchovci site (White Carpathian Mountains, W Slovakia) and compared these with pollen, plant macrofossil and mollusc data. According to δ18O, two distinct thermal maxima occurred in the region, around 11.4 ka and between 7.3 and 6.9 ka BP. According to δ13C and Mg/Ca ratio, a steep increase in moisture and rainfall took place around 8.5 ka cal. BP, preceded by a cold and dry event. These events are well reflected in the biotic proxies and are suggested also by other palaeoenvironmental studies from the Carpathians. We found some later fluctuations, with dry and warm Bronze Age (ca. 3.6 ka cal. BP), cold and wet Urnfield period (ca. 2.8 ka cal. BP), warm Roman period (ca. 2 ka cal. BP) and cold but humid Migration period (ca. 1.5 ka cal. BP). We observed extreme abruptness and amplitude of the variation in all geochemical proxies in the last 500 years, when biotic proxies imply a very intense human deforestation. Land-use changes may have altered both the temperature regime in the studied fen and the carbon cycle in the recharge area.},

  abstract = {Steep terrain and high a frequency of tropical rainstorms make landslide occurrence on natural terrain a common phenomenon in Hong Kong. This paper reports on the use of a Geographical Information Systems (GIS) database, compiled primarily from existing digital maps and aerial photographs, to describe the physical characteristics of landslides and the statistical relations of landslide frequency with the physical parameters contributing to the initiation of landslides on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. The horizontal travel length and the angle of reach, defined as the angle of the line connecting the head of the landslide source to the distal margin of the displaced mass, are used to describe runout behavior of landslide mass. For all landslides studied, the horizontal travel length of landslide mass ranges from 5 to 785 m, with a mean value of 43 m, and the average angle of reach is 27.7??. This GIS database is then used to obtain a logistic multiple regression model for predicting slope instability. It is indicated that slope gradient, lithology, elevation, slope aspect, and land-use are statistically significant in predicting slope instability, while slope morphology and proximity to drainage lines are not important and thus excluded from the model. This model is then imported back into the GIS to produce a map of predicted slope instability. The results of this study demonstrate that slope instability can be effectively modeled by using GIS technology and logistic multiple regression analysis. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Gravity collapse structures are common features on passive margins and typically have a tripartite configuration including an updip extensional domain, a transitional domain and a downdip compressional domain with a common detachment underlying the system. A number of studies have classified these systems, yet few document the wide variations in geometry. This study documents the gravity collapse structures of the Namibian and South African Orange Basin; these structures represent some of the best imaged examples of this important process. We first demonstrate the geometry and kinematic evolution of these systems, focusing on examples of the tripartite configuration from a typical collapse. We then highlight the significant variability in the structures of the system and describe features such as cross-cutting in margin-parallel sections, portions of the system with multiple detachments, systems with stacked synchronous detachments and the temporal evolution of faults within the system. By integrating our observations from a number of sections, we present a model explaining the spatial and temporal evolution of the system. This enables us to discuss likely causes of collapse structures and also, by placing the system into a well-constrained stratigraphic context, how the presence of both maximum flooding surfaces and early margin deltaic sequences have a fundamental control on the resulting collapse geometry.},

  abstract = {Complex spatial heterogeneity in riverbed and floodplain sediments control the spatio-temporal exchange of groundwater and surface water in the hyporheic zone, inducing hot spots of microbial activity and biogeochemical cycling. However, the characterization of hyporheic exchange dynamics has thus far failed to adequately account for the complex subsurface heterogeneity of river bed sediments in a spatial explicitly manner, in particular for highly complex lowland river bed sediments. Here we demonstrate the ability of ground penetrating radar (GPR) to efficiently map floodplain and river bed sediment structures within a lowland meandering river. The aim of this study was to delineate the type and spatial extent of complex, texturally heterogeneous facies of high and low conductive streambed materials. GPR surveys in this study involved not only state-of-the-art terrestrial applications but also an aquatic survey conducted from a floating rig. The surveys revealed substantial sub-surface heterogeneity of depositional materials in the streambed and riparian zone. Eight characteristic radar facies were identified through the floodplain and ground-truthed against core samples and exposures of bank deposits. The majority of GPR profiles were dominated by trough-shaped depositional elements with erosional, curved, concave upward bounding surfaces, indicative of abandoned and chute stream channel structures. The identified abandoned channel structure was found to extend into the riverbed and to be filled by suspension fall-out fine-grained deposits (mud with organic matter and interbedded clay as indicated by observed signal attenuations). GPR proved to be a successful method to identify the spatial patterns of low conductivity peat and clay structures in the streambed and riparian zone of the investigated meander bend, highlighting its potential for larger scale analysis of these structures that have shown to control the exchange flow patterns between groundwater and surface water in lowland rivers.},

Comparison of these data with the results of similar experiments conducted on unfrozen joints indicates that at low temperatures and normal stresses the strength of an ice-filled joint can be significantly higher than that of an unfrozen joint. However, in the absence of sufficient closure pressure, the strength of an ice-filled joint can be significantly less than that of an unfrozen joint. This implies that if the stability of a slope is maintained by ice-filled joints, its factor of safety will reduce with temperature rise. This hypothesis suggests that a jointed rock slope that is stable when there is no ice in the joints and is also stable when ice in the joints is at low temperatures will become unstable as the ice warms. Results from the model tests have confirmed this hypothesis. Copyright  2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

We use these data to generate new empirical reconstructions of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS) and subsequent ice masses and ice-dammed palaeolakes at 35 ka, 30 ka, 25 ka, 20 ka, 15 ka, 13 ka (synchronous with the Antarctic Cold Reversal), 10 ka, 5 ka, 0.2 ka and 2011 AD. At 35 ka, the PIS covered of 492.6 x103 km2, had a sea level equivalent of \textasciitilde 1,496 mm, was 350 km wide and 2090 km long, and was grounded on the Pacific continental shelf edge. Outlet glacier lobes remained topographically confined and the largest generated the suites of subglacial streamlined bedforms characteristic of ice streams. The PIS reached its maximum extent by 33 – 28 ka from 38°S to 48°S, and earlier, around 47 ka from 48°S southwards. Net retreat from maximum positions began by 25 ka, with ice-marginal stabilisation then at 21 – 18 ka, which was then followed by rapid irreversible deglaciation. By 15 ka, the PIS had separated into disparate ice masses, draining into large ice-dammed lakes along the eastern margin, which strongly influenced rates of recession. Glacial readvances or stabilisations occurred at least at 14 – 13 ka, 11 ka, 6 – 5 ka, 2 – 1 ka, and 0.5 – 0.2 ka.

The interplay between glacial, paraglacial and periglacial processes in this semi-arid polar environment is important in understanding polygenetic landforms. Crucially, cold-based ice was capable of sediment and landform genesis and modification.

  abstract = {The disharmonic outcrop-scale folds and associated structures in a 300-m-thick Cretaceous limestone formation in the Pindos Group exposed on Mount Lykaion (Arcadia, Greece) can be understood only in the context of superposed pre-tectonic and tectonic mass-transfer dissolution creep. Though the structures described may seem unusual, they are undoubtedly abundant in strongly deformed pseudobedded limestone formations. In this example the Thick White Limestone Beds (TWLB) formation displays pervasive “flaggy” pseudobedding, which is a diagenetic stylolitic layering resulting from pressure dissolution. The mass-transfer dissolution creep that produced the diagenetic stylolitic surfaces was achieved during gravitational loading accompanying burial, compaction, and lithification, and was driven by high stress concentrations at grain contacts. The diagenetic stylolitic surfaces are lined with insoluble residue and commonly are marked by interlocking stylolite teeth oriented perpendicular to the pseudo-bedding. At the outcrop scale, individual pseudo-beds display significant thickness variability. Moreover, the individual pseudo-beds not uncommonly wedge out and disappear laterally over very short distances.},

  abstract = {There is a lack of high-resolution records of hydroclimate variability in the Eastern Mediterranean from the late glacial and early Holocene. More knowledge of the speed of climate shifts and the degree to which they were synchronous with changes in the North Atlantic or elsewhere is required to understand better the controls on Eastern Mediterranean climate. Using endogenic carbonate from a sediment sequence from Nar Go€lü, a maar lake in central Turkey, dated by varve counting and uranium-thorium methods, we present high-resolution (\textasciitilde 25 years) oxygen (d18O) and carbon isotope records, supported by carbonate mineralogy data, spanning the late glacial and Holocene. d18Ocarbonate at Nar Go€lü has been shown previously to be a strong proxy for regional water balance. After a dry period (i.e. evaporation far exceeding precipitation) in the Younger Dryas, the data show a transition into the relatively wetter early Holocene. In the early Holocene there are two drier periods that appear to peak at \textasciitilde 9.3 ka and \textasciitilde 8.2 ka, coincident with cooling ‘events’ seen in North Atlantic records. After this, and as seen in other records from the Eastern Mediterranean, there is a millennial-scale drying trend through the Mid Holocene Transition. The relatively dry late Holocene is punctuated by centennial-scale drought intervals, at the times of 4.2 ka ‘event’ and Late Bronze Age societal ‘collapse’. Overall, we show that central Turkey is drier when the North Atlantic is cooler, throughout this record and at multiple timescales, thought to be due to a weakening of the westerly storm track resulting from reduced cyclogenesis in the North Atlantic. However, some features, such as the Mid Holocene Transition and the fact the early Holocene dry episodes at Nar Go€lü are of a longer duration than the more discrete ‘events’ seen in North Atlantic records, imply there are additional controls on Eastern Mediterranean hydroclimate.},

Acheron Dorsum is crossed by deep and wide fractures (“fossae”, here referred to also as Linear Depressions or “LDs”), commonly interpreted as grabens formed by local lithosphere stress in response to endogenous mantle upwelling. We suggest an alternate view that the linear depressions may result from gravitational self-adjustment of a loose deposit similar to the Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformations (DSGSD or Sackung), a kind of slow mass movement well documented on Earth. Numerical simulations based on a finite difference numerical model devised for terrestrial DSGSDs reproduce the timing and position of LDs reasonably well provided that the viscosity of the viscoplastic layer is between ≈7 1015 and ≈1017 Pa s. While rock masses typically exhibit much higher values, based on comparison with glacial examples, we find that these viscosities could be compatible to a rock–ice mixture.},

  abstract = {Neotectonics is a major factor controlling landform development in tectonically active regions, and it has significantly affected fluvial systems and mountain-front landscapes in the Sarvestan area of the central Zagros, Iran. The area is located along the simply folded belt of the Zagros, and is an outcome of the SW–NE oriented tectonic conversion that initiated in the Late Cretaceous and strengthened during the Early Miocene due to the collision of the Arabian and Eurasian plates. To assess tectonic activities in the area, we analyzed geomorphic indices: the stream-gradient index (SL), drainage basin asymmetry (Af), hypsometric integral (Hi), valley floor width–valley height ratio (Vf), drainage basin shape (Bs), and mountain-front sinuosity (J). These indices were combined to yield the relative active tectonics index (Iat) using geographic information systems (GIS). Based on Iat values, the study area was divided into four parts: Class 1 (very high relative tectonic activity, 1.0\% in area); Class 2 (high, 20.0\%); Class 3 (moderate, 67.0\%), and Class 4 (low, 12.0\%). The results are consistent with field observations on landforms and geology.},

  abstract = {A systematic compilation and characterisation of many reports of neotectonic crustal deformation in Norway (both on local and regional scales) has identi"ed two neotectonic faults in northern Norway. The Stuoragurra Fault is a large reverse fault in Finnmark County. The Nordmannvikdalen fault is a much smaller normal fault in Troms County. The Stuoragurra postglacial fault can be followed, in several discontinuous sections, for 80 km, in a NE\vphantom\{\}SW direction. The fault has up to 10 m of displacement. During 1998, two trenches were made across the fault. The hanging wall was seen to be thrust upwards over the footwall, with 7 m vertical displacement evident from displaced glacial contacts. The fault did not penetrate the overlying glacial materials, but rather folded them, forming a blind thrust. Large liquefaction and other deformation structures were found in the glacio\#uvial sediments in both trenches. Veins of angular and subangular pebbles from the local bedrock penetrate more than 10 m laterally from the thrust plane and into the sediments in the footwall. It is thought that these veins were injected during the fault activity. The major deformation of the sediments has a deH collement plane that continues laterally in the E/B horizon contact of the modern soil on top of the footwall. This may indicate that an initial pedogenesis had taken place before the fault activity occurred, however no macro plant fossils to support this were found in the possible buried soil. Deformational structures seen in the trench can be explained as a result of one major fault event. The Nordmannvikdalen postglacial fault is a NW\vphantom\{\}SE trending normal fault, dipping to the NE. The fault o!sets till on the NW slope of Nordmannvikdalen. The escarpment varies in height from 0.5 to 1.5 m, with a trench often present between the hanging wall and the footwall. The fault locally splits into two subparallel branches, however this is probably only in the glacial overburden. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) pro"les show two prominent bedrock re\#ectors, dipping approximately 403 to the NE. An upward extrapolation of the northernmost re\#ector through the overburden coincides with the position of the surface scarp. The bedrock is well exposed along a streamed parallel to the GPR pro"les. Bedding and foliation cannot be responsible for the re\#ectors visible in the GPR pro"les. Gravitational forces have been ruled out as the origin of the fault. Although both faults probably formed shortly after Weichselian deglaciation, there is evidence that isostatic uplift was not the only force acting. Quaternary tilting of Fennoscandia due to ridge push, or mantle convection, may also play a role in neotectonic activity in Norway. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Currently, global warming due to increasing concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is widely accepted. Climate is an important forcing parameter of landslides and, hence, implications of climate change for landslide activity are of high concern for geomorphological research. The present paper offers a method for assessing climate change impacts on landslide frequency based on general circulation models ŽGCM.. GCM results are downscaled with an empirical–statistical technique to derive local precipitation scenarios. These scenarios are used as input to a simple slope hydrological and stability model. The landslide is defined ‘active’ if simulated groundwater levels exceed a critical level established with the stability model. Recurrence intervals for landslide activity are obtained by applying a Gumbel regression to the simulated annual maximum groundwater levels. Furthermore, it is shown that indirect climate change impacts as well as changing non-climatic parameters can be important for future landslide frequencies too. The use of three different GCM experiments for the assessment of the activity of a small landslide in SE France did not show a consistent picture of future landslide frequencies. This is due to differences between the GCM experiments but might be enhanced by the limited ability of the applied downscaling technique to carry climate change signals. Finally, some possibilities of improving the approach are outlined and the need for better GCM experiments, which provide the basic input of the approach, is addressed. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {A series of 3-D visualization approaches is presented with the aim of developing better interpretation tools for field-based geologists. Structural data from outcrop, mine and regional scales are used to create speculative 3-D surfaces that can be useful in addressing geological problems. These tools could help in resolving cryptic early fold geometries, extending stratiform mineralizations and the sub-surface interpretation of regional thrusts, unconformities or key lithostratigraphic boundaries. Using sparse data sets from the low-relief and structurally complex Archean Abitibi greenstone belt, I have demonstrated that speculative models can be created from such challenging terrains, provided that existing data are respected and that appropriate methods are applied at a given scale. Examples focus on optimizing the 3-D editing environment for making better interpretations. Applied techniques include custom projections of surface traces, 3-D digitizing, simple BÃ©zier surface patches, and non-cylindrical fold construction using field based plunge models. These are implemented as several UNIX AWK programs in conjunction with commercial 3-D visualization and modeling software gOcadÂ© and EarthVisionÂ©. This integration and visualization study shows that complex fold geometries can be more rigorously constructed using constraining structural field data, but that current 3-D technologies are still very cumbersome for hard rock applications. Future development of field based case studies that will help validate and communicate the benefit of these methods is much needed, and will hopefully better articulate specific requirements to software developers. Professional 3-D software developers are encouraged to work towards the implementation of these types of programs in order to move the regional mapping community beyond 2-D and 21/2-D GIS-based modeling. National surveys and explorationists who are responsible for the collection, management, and archiving of geoscience data need to be diligent in maintaining their structural field data. This will be especially critical as 3-D visualization and modeling techniques, such as those I have presented here, become available to the bedrock mapping community.},

  abstract = {Rock avalanches onto glacier surfaces, involving volumes 1~Mm3 or more, are common in the glacier environments of NW North America. We analyse the Mount Munday rock avalanche (British Columbia) which occurred in July 1997. It involved the initial movement of 3.2~Mm3 of granitic gneiss that underwent a high degree of fragmentation as it was emplaced on Ice Valley Glacier as a thin 2.6-km2 debris sheet. The total height of the path was 850~m, and its length was 4,163~m yielding a fahrböschung of 10°, suggestive of a long runout in relation to volume. Potential energy expended in the movement was calculated as 4.33\,×\,1013~J and its specific energy was estimated at 5,204~J/kg. A simulation of the movement using 2D DAN-W and DAN 3D strongly supports the idea that debris sheet geometry (runout and thickness) and behaviour (velocity profile) resulted from movement on a low friction surface (glacier ice). Our analysis of the debris sheet geometry of 23 unconstrained rock avalanches on glacier surfaces in NW North America indicated that the debris sheets are distinct from those in non-glacial environments in that they are (a) longer in relation to volume and (b) more extensive in area in relation to volume. These two effects result in a very thin supra-glacial debris sheet. Using image analysis software, we found that ∼85~\% of the initial source rock volume was fragmented to fragment sizes less than 4.7~m3 in volume during emplacement, and that within the debris sheet, the highest degree of fragmentation is associated with the thinnest debris. In the emplacement of rock avalanche debris sheets on glacier surfaces, the low friction glacier surface drives debris sheet thinning through spreading, which in turn results in the fragmentation of its entire thickness. We thus propose low friction surface-driven fragmentation as a process that contributes to long runout of rock avalanches on glacier surfaces and explains their distinctive debris sheet geometry.},

  abstract = {High-resolution lidar reveals newly recognized evidence of strong shaking in the New Madrid seismic zone in the central United States. We mapped concentrations of sackungen (ridgetop spreading features) on bluffs along the eastern Mississippi River valley in northwestern Tennessee that likely form or are reactivated during large earthquakes. These sackungen are concentrated on the hanging wall of the Reelfoot reverse fault and show a preferential orientation indicating ground failure normal to fault strike. These observations suggest that the sackungen record one or more earthquakes on the southern Reelfoot fault since the deposition of the \textasciitilde 30- to 11-ka Peoria Loess and potentially constrain the minimum intensity of near-fault ground motion. This study demonstrates that sackungen can be used to infer fault source and mechanism and, in combination with field-based techniques, improve paleoseismic records and seismic hazard models. Plain Language Summary High-detail digital elevation maps reveal new evidence of strong shaking from earthquakes in the New Madrid seismic zone in the central United States. We mapped ridgetop spreading and sagging on bluffs in northwestern Tennessee that likely form during large earthquakes. These spreading features are located near the compressional Reelfoot fault, are concentrated on the surface above the fault plane, and more commonly spread perpendicular to the fault. These observations suggest that these features record one or more earthquakes on the southern Reelfoot fault since the deposition of the underlying silt \textasciitilde 30,000–11,000 years ago. The shaking features also provide constraints on the intensity of ground shaking near the Reelfoot fault. This study demonstrates that ridgetop spreading features can be used to infer which fault generated past earthquakes and the type of movement that occurred on the fault, and, in combination with other research techniques, expand the record of past earthquakes and lead to improved seismic hazard models.},

Rock avalanches also have strong implications are for relief generation and destruction though time. Both consequences make reconstruction and dating of past events crucial, but dense clusters of events documented in one basin that may improve our knowledge of rock-avalanche frequency and triggering are very rare. Here we propose a chronology of seven of the rock-ice avalanches that affected a steep glacier basin on the southeast side of the Mont Blanc during the late Holocene. A geomorphological study of the runout deposits on the valley floor and the opposite side was combined with the analysis of historical sources and the use of absolute and relative dating methods, especially surface exposure dating with cosmogenic nuclides of 18 granite boulders from two deposits.},

The Lanzada DSD is a constantly monitored, juvenile, and active phenomenon, partly affecting an existing hydropower plant. Its well-developed landforms allow a precise field characterization of the instability-affected area. The Sarre DSD is a mature, strongly remodeled phenomenon, where the only hazard factor is represented by secondary instability processes at the base of the slope. In this case, the remodeling imposed the adoption of complementary analytical techniques to support the field work. The two presented studies had to be adapted to external factors, namely (a) available information, (b) geological and geomorphological setting, and (c) final scope of the work. The Lanzada case essentially relied upon accurate field work; the Sarre case was mostly based on digital image and DTM processing. In both cases a sound field structural analysis formed the necessary background to understand the mechanisms leading to instability. A back-analysis of the differences between the study methods adopted in the two cases is finally presented, leading to suggestions for further investigations and design.},

  abstract = {A landslide susceptibility map is proposed for the Pays de Herve (E Belgium), where large landslides affect Cretaceous clay outcrop areas. Based on a Bayesian approach, this GIS-supported probabilistic map identifies the areas most susceptible to deep landslides. The database is comprised of the source areas of ten pre-existing landslides (i.e. a sample of 154 grid cells) and of six environmental data layers, namely lithology, proximity to active faults, slope angle and aspect, elevation and distance to the nearest valley-floor. A 30-m-resolution DEM from the Belgian National Geographical Institute is used for the analysis. Owing to the small size of the sample, a special cross-validation procedure of the susceptibility map is performed, which uses in an iterative way each of the landslides to test the predictive power of the map derived from the other landslides. Four different sets of variables are used to produce four susceptibility maps, whose prediction curves are compared. While the prediction rates associated with the models not involving the “proximity to active fault” criterion are comparable to those of the models considering this variable, strong weaknesses inherent in the fault data on which the latter rely suggest that the final susceptibility map should be based on a model that excludes any reference to fault. This highlights the difference between a triggering factor and determining factors, and in the same time broadens the scope of the produced map. A single reactivated slide is also used to test the possibility of predicting future reactivation of existing landslides in the area. Finally, the need for geomorphological control over the mathematical treatment is underlined in order to obtain realistic prediction maps.},

  abstract = {Large scale landslides are common in the Three Gorges reservoir region due to steep slopes and complex geological conditions, fluctuations of reservoir level, etc. Many phenomena and formation mechanisms related to these landslides are not well understood and need more research. In this study, large scale landslide evolution and formation mechanisms are thoroughly investigated in terms of precedent long-term gravitational deformation (PLTGD). Three large scale landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir region, Huangtupo landslide (HTPL), Huanglashi landslide (HLSL), and Baotaping landslide (BTPL), are taken for example to discuss their phenomena and features of PLTGD, and to investigate the correlation between the PLTGDs and landslide. Many features associated with landslides are caused by slow, downslope gravitational processes before landslide failure, and three criteria for recognition of the PLTGD features are summarized. The investigation results reveal that the PLTGDs play an important role in landslide evolution and formation mechanism. Overall, this paper presents evidences for PLTGDs of large scale landslides and their correlation with landslide evolution, which is helpful to understand the formation mechanism of large scale landslides in the Three Gorges reservoir region.},

We describe a simple observational test to distinguish between storm and earthquake triggers based on a probabilistic measure of hillslope morphology. In areas that are dominated by storm-triggered landslides, steep topographic slopes are concentrated on the lowermost parts of the hillslopes. Storm triggers act primarily on the hillslope toes, and landslides preferentially remove material from those locations, giving rise to inner gorges. Areas where most landslides are earthquake triggered have more uniform spatial distributions of steep topographic slopes, because coseismic shaking causes failures at both ridge crests and hillslope toes. Earthquake-triggered landslides lead to planar hillslopes and rare or absent inner gorges.},

  abstract = {Quantifying denudation rates in a wide range of climatic and tectonic settings at various time and space scales is a critical step in calibrating and validating landscape evolution models. Focusing on Taiwan, we quantified centennial rates of denudation at the scale of the whole orogen, using in situ 10Be concentrations measured in stream sediments collected at the outlets of major rivers. To assess denudation rates that are statistically significant, we applied both the mean square weighted deviation approach and the bootstrap technique. For the central segment of the belt, where the collision is considered to be near mature, the orogen-scale pattern of denudation shows a two-fold pattern: (1) higher denudation values on the order of 4–5 mm/yr characterize the eastern side of the belt (i.e., retro-wedge), with a slight increase towards the south and (2) lower denudation values on the order of 1–3 mm/yr on the western side of the belt (pro-wedge) with a minimum value centered on the main recess of the deformation front. To the north and to the south of the central segment, the denudation rates converge towards lower values on the order of 2–3 mm/yr. At the scale of the mountain belt, drainage basin metrics such as relief, hypsometric index and slope values seem to explain the observed variance in the data population, conversely to the first-order average precipitation pattern, suggesting a strong tectonic control on the regional pattern of denudation rates. Applied to the whole orogen, such field-based approach thus provides important input data to validate and calibrate the parameters to be supplied to landscape evolution models.},

The north – south, half-dome shaped Maiella anticline lies in the easternmost part of the Apennine fold-and-thrust belt. Its backlimb is bordered by the Caramanico Fault, a normal fault with a maximum downthrown of about 3.5 km that separates the western slope of the Maiella Massif from the Caramanico Valley. The southwestern Maiella area is affected by deep-seated gravitational slope deformation indicated by major double crest lines, down-hill and up-hill facing scarps, a pattern of crossing trenches, bulging at the base of slopes and the presence of different types of landslide and talus slope deposits.},

  abstract = {A study of deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) phenomena affecting areas of various geological and geomorphological settings in western Sicily is described. Western Sicily is underlain by a thin-skinned imbricate wedge of Meso–Cenozoic carbonate and siliciclastic rocks that formed by the stacking of several thrust nappes over the Iblean foreland. Locally, the original thrust sheets are folded and cut by high-angle faults. Large areas of western Sicily now display high relief energy due to Plio-Pleistocene block-faulting and uplifting, and the Quaternary morphogenetic phases are characterised by incision, thereby triggering widespread DSGSDs. To identify controlling factors and triggering causes and to develop reliable morphoevolutionary models for the DSGSDs of western Sicily, a geomorphological study based on field surveys and aerial-photography interpretations was performed. Previous geomorphological data relating to well-known examples of DSGSDs were reconsidered, leading to remarkable revisions of the interpretative models in certain cases. New data were subsequently collected, enabling recognition of additional DSGSD phenomena. The whole body of data involves a total of 27 DSGSDs affecting areas in two specific geological settings: (1) areas with flat thrust surfaces, where differential settlements, back-tilting, lateral spreads in competent rocks overlying marls and clays, large topples, and/or block-type slope movements may develop; and (2) areas where deep-rooted carbonate units come into lateral contact with clayey–marly units along high-angle faults, where lateral spreads in brittle homogeneous rocks, sinking, and/or rock flows may occur. These DSGSD phenomena are associated with different evolutionary stages, allowing a morphoevolutionary model to be defined for the two geological conditions. For these two different morphoevolutionary models, the following structural features play an important role in the development of DSGSDs: (1) where carbonate bodies overlie clayey–marly rocks, triggering of the DSGSDs traces back to deformation of a ductile substratum that follows the exhumation of the flat thrust planes and the underlying clayey–marly rocks due to block-faulting and/or stream incision; and (2) where homogeneous carbonate rocks hundreds of metres thick crop out, the DSGSDs are triggered by very high relief energy and tensile stress that follow the combined actions of Quaternary block-faulting and stream deepening associated with differential erosion.},

  abstract = {Deep-Seated Gravitational Slope Deformations (DSGSDs) are complex, slope-scale, gravity-driven phenomena, which are placed between landslide movements s.s. and gravitational tectonics. These processes, which develop over very long time periods, are considerably relevant both for the remarkable influence on the evolution of hillslope morphology and for risk associated with the induced deformations and the possible evolution into catastrophic landslides. A large number of studies on DSGSDs was produced in the scientific literature; the lack of a widely recognized classification, together with the great variability of shapes and characteristics, have led to the development of numerous terminologies and definitions, which make the approach to these phenomena particularly complex. Despite this, it is possible to identify some fundamental characteristics, both in terms of kinematic mechanisms and induced morphological elements and of controlling factors and possible evolution. In more recent years, some studies highlighted the relevance of the elevated spatial and temporal scales that feature DSGSDs, with specific reference to the time-dependent rheology regulating the deformation of rock masses as a prominent distinctive feature of such processes. This study describes the current state of the art, starting from both the numerous works present in the literature and specialized review articles aimed at individual aspects of these phenomena. The work is developed in order to describe both the history of scientific progress in this field and all the main aspects that characterize the phenomena in question, both in terms of intrinsic characteristics and in relation to the control factors and possible evolution. Through the analyzes of literature data, indications are given on the space-time scale and on the characteristics that allow to distinguish DSGSDs from other gravitational phenomena.},

  abstract = {A method that employs hot dehydrated phosphoric acid (pyrophosphoric acid) to isolate quartz from rock for surface exposure dating with 10Be and 26Al has been improved so that up to 250 g of sample can be decomposed reasonably safely. Because pyrophosphoric acid is more selective in dissolving the silicate minerals than the commonly used mixture of dilute hydrofluoric and nitric acids, the yield of quartz is relatively high. However, serious hazards arise from using large volumes of hot concentrated phosphoric acid to decompose rock. When the acid is heated to evaporate water and initiate the reaction, the crushed rock settles to the bottom of the vessel causing the mixture to superheat and ''bump'' severely. Then, as the reaction progresses, the mixture increases in viscosity and will form a solid gel if allowed to cool. Starting with a greater excess of phosphoric acid to reduce the viscosity is impractical for such large amounts of rock so, to avoid a solid gel at the end of the reaction, the mixture has to be diluted with cold water while it is still near 250 °C. This step is particularly dangerous as the water at first instantaneously turns to steam that can eject gel resulting in serious thermal burns even through thick gloves. We have mitigated these hazards by keeping the sample suspended using a mixer throughout the procedure. There is no superheating at the start and water can be added slowly at the end thus quenching the reaction and dispersing the particulate matter. Another hazard, boiling sodium hydroxide solution, has been minimised and may ultimately be eliminated. This report covers the prototype mixer, safety features of the new mixer under construction, and an interim procedure for decomposing rock and recovering pure quartz.},

  abstract = {The stability of high rock slopes is largely controlled by the location and orientation of geological features, such as faults, folds, joints, and bedding planes, which can induce structurally controlled slope instability. Under certain conditions, slope kinematics may vary with time, as propagation of existing fractures due to brittle failure may allow development of fully persistent release surfaces. In this paper, the progressive accumulation of brittle damage that occurred prior to and during the 2014 San Leo landslide (northern Italy) is investigated using a synthetic rock mass (SRM) approach. Mapping of brittle fractures, rock bridge failures, and major structures is undertaken using terrestrial laser scanning, photogrammetry, and high-resolution photography. Numerical analyses are conducted to investigate the role of intact rock fracturing on the evolution of kinematic freedom using the two-dimensional Finite-discrete element method (FDEM) code Elfen, and the three-dimensional lattice-spring scheme code Slope Model. Numerical analyses show that the gradual erosion of clay-rich material below the base of the plateau drives the brittle propagation of fractures within the rock mass, until a fully persistent, subvertical rupture surface form, causing toppling of fault-bounded rock columns. This study clearly highlights the potential role of intact rock fracturing on the slope kinematics, and the interaction between intact rock strength, structural geology, and slope morphology.},

In this paper, we investigate slope damage at the Downie Slide, a very large landslide in British Columbia, Canada, that is slowly moving along two shear zones subparallel to the ground surface. Structural geology, and particularly the morphology of the lower shear zone, strongly controls the deformation and, in turn, the observed internal and surficial slope damage features. We use aerial and underground adit laser scanning and photogrammetry to characterize the geometry of the landslide. We subdivide the slide area into slope damage domains based on the distribution, size, and orientation of the slope damage features. We reconstruct the shape of the two failure surfaces by interpolating borehole inclinometer monitoring data and processing the 3D surfaces in a GIS environment to create aspect and slope maps. We observe a strong correlation between surficial slope damage features and changes in the dip and dip direction of the lower sliding surface. We further infer the presence of a multi-planar failure surface geometry and previously unrecognized structurally controlled damage zones.},

First, the basic mechanics of rockfall are summarized, including knowledge of the main modes of motion: falling, bouncing and rolling. Secondly, existing models are divided in three groups: (1) empirical models, (2) process-based models and (3) Geophysical Information System (GIS)-based models. For each model type its basic principles and ability to predict rockfall runout zones are summarized. The final part is a discussion of how a model for predicting rockfall runout zones at a regional scale should be developed. A GIS-based distribution model is suggested that combines a detailed process-based model and a GIS. Potential rockfall source areas and falltracks are calculated by the GIS component of the model and the rockfall runout zones are calculated by the process-based component. In addition to this model, methods for the estimation of model parameters values at a regional scale have to be developed.},

In this study, I quantify thermally and ice-induced rock and fracture kinematics and place these in the context of their role in producing rockfall and climate change. I conducted laboratory measurements on intact rock samples and installed temperature loggers and crackmeters at four rockwalls reaching from 2585 to 2935 m in elevation in the Hungerli Valley, Swiss Alps. My laboratory data show that thermal expansion followed three phases of rock kinematics, which resulted in a hysteresis effect. In the field, control crackmeters on intact rock reflected these temperature phases, and based on thermal expansion coefficients of these observed phases, I modelled thermal stress. Model results show that thermal stress magnitudes were predominantly below rock strengths. Crackmeters across fractures revealed fracture opening during cooling and reverse closing behaviour during warming on daily timescales. Elevation-dependent snow cover controlled the number of daily temperature changes and thermal stresses affecting both intact and fractured rock, while the magnitude is controlled by topographic factors influencing insolation. On a seasonal scale, slow ice-segregation-induced fracture opening can occur within lithology-dependent temperature regimes called frost cracking windows. Shear plane dipping controlled whether fractures opened or closed irreversibly with time due to thermally induced block crawling on an annual scale. Climate change will shorten snow duration and increase temperature extremes and will, therefore, affect the number and the magnitude of thermal changes and associated stresses. Earlier snowmelt in combination with temperature increase will shift the ice-induced kinematic processes to higher elevations. In conclusion, climate change will affect and change rock and fracture kinematics and, therefore, change rockfall patterns in alpine environments. Future work should quantify rockfall patterns and link these patterns to climatic drivers.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Increasing availability of high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) is leading to a paradigm shift regarding scale issues in geomorphometry, prompting new solutions to cope with multi-scale analysis and detection of characteristic scales. We tested the suitability of the local variance (LV) method, originally developed for image analysis, for multi-scale analysis in geomorphometry. The method consists of: 1) upscaling land-surface parameters derived from a DEM; 2) calculating LV as the average standard deviation (SD) within a 3 × 3 moving window for each scale level; 3) calculating the rate of change of LV (ROC-LV) from one level to another, and 4) plotting values so obtained against scale levels. We interpreted peaks in the ROC-LV graphs as markers of scale levels where cells or segments match types of pattern elements characterized by (relatively) equal degrees of homogeneity. The proposed method has been applied to LiDAR DEMs in two test areas different in terms of roughness: low relief and mountainous, respectively. For each test area, scale levels for slope gradient, plan, and profile curvatures were produced at constant increments with either resampling (cell-based) or image segmentation (object-based). Visual assessment revealed homogeneous areas that convincingly associate into patterns of land-surface parameters well differentiated across scales. We found that the LV method performed better on scale levels generated through segmentation as compared to upscaling through resampling. The results indicate that coupling multi-scale pattern analysis with delineation of morphometric primitives is possible. This approach could be further used for developing hierarchical classifications of landform elements.},

  abstract = {The southern part of the French Alps is studied for years in mapping and understanding of large-scale gravitational deformations. The identification and the knowledge of large-scale slope deformation (deep-seated gravitational slope deformation or DSGSD and deep-seated landslide or DSL) in the previous work of Jomard (2006) and Zerathe (2013) open a new vision of landslide processes with the reinterpretation of their dynamics and the characterization of the time scales involved. We identify DSGSD (10.109 m3) in the Var Valley associated with geological and geomorphological anomalies linked to the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) and the alpine orogenesis. We use field observations, geological information (geological map, boreholes), and topographic analysis performed in a GIS environment in order to describe these anomalies. This old and partly eroded slide mass is associated with three typical DSGSD features: (1) a double-crested ridge, the Sinne Valley, (2) a large formation (2.7 × 108 m3) of slope deposit dated from the Messinian (Carros breccia), and (3) the kilometric deviation (1 to 2 km) of the Var River. We relate all these anomalies to the MSC (5.97 to 5.46 Ma) and the incision of deep canyons during this period related to this major eustatic variation (≈ 1300 m). The incision of the canyon triggered the collapse process of the DSGSD of the Sinne Valley and so destabilized the entire massif. At present, three DSLs resulting from the DSGSD deformation are still present in the area in a dormant state. Indeed, since the infilling of the Var Canyon during the Pliocene, the activity of the DSGSD has stopped.},

  abstract = {Detailed sedimentological studies concerning different facies types and the factors influencing their development (such as lithology, topography, substrates, etc.) were carried out at the carbonate Tschirgant rockslide-rock avalanche deposit in the Eastern Alps of Austria. Several depositional facies and sub-facies have been identified at this and other sites by many researchers. These facies are found throughout the debris, regardless of depth or travel distance, and result from highly heterogeneous stress distributions in time and space during emplacement. One of the most important recent observations in terms of emplacement dynamics is that shear is not confined to the base, but is distributed throughout the debris (except the coarse carapace). Due to the preservation of source stratigraphy in these non-turbulent mass movements, any horizontal facies or grain size variations need to be regarded in context since they strongly depend on source stratigraphy and hence the spatial distribution of lithologies (i.e. geological units of different mechanical properties). For example, some lithologies do not form a boulder carapace due to absence of large in-situ blocks in the source rock mass. However, at Tschirgant, slight facies “maturation” with distance (within the same lithology) is observed, i.e. clast fragmentation progresses to create the distinct, facies-characteristic grain size distribution only after some distance travelled. These details are revealed through facies-based sampling and analysis. Studies based on bulk sampling, in some cases, observed progressively reduced grain sizes with distance and depth – which might be a function of added variations within different facies sampled together. In this paper, the wealth of observations on rockslide and rock avalanche sedimentology of the past decades is combined with a detailed case study of a (lithologically) relatively simple deposit, to outline global and site-specific depositional structures and facies with the aim to summarize, review, and refine the current state of knowledge on rock avalanche and rockslide emplacement processes.},

  abstract = {The Himalayan range is one of the most tectonically active mountain ranges on Earth. The Jilong Valley is a deeply-dissected canyon in the Chinese Himalayas in Tibet, and in this valley, landslide hazard and risk have increased significantly in response to active crustal movements, intense rainfall and ever-increasing human interference. Landslide susceptibility assessment in the valley is fundamental for risk mitigation and to inform land use and planning but remains a challenge owing to the inaccessible high altitude and incomplete landslide inventory. In addition, because of sustained glacial erosion, weathering, and denudation, there is considerable uncertainty in the use of remote sensing interpretation of landslides in high-altitude terrain. In this paper, therefore, a systematic approach for landslide susceptibility assessment is proposed, combining the interpretations from remotely sensed dataset and both heuristic and statistical susceptibility models to overcome the problem of the limited spatial coverage of landslide data and uncertainty in landslide interpretation. The main steps include: 1) landslide field investigation and interpretation and the compilation of a preliminary landslide inventory, including certain and probable landslides, 2) knowledge-driven identification of landslide-prone areas based on the heuristic model, 3) classification and quantification of the uncertainty of probable landslides through heuristic landslide-prone areas mapping and the production of a revised landslide inventory, and 4) data-driven susceptibility assessment using a statistical model. In the statistical model, the landslide samples have multivalent dependent variables between 0 and 1. Therefore, a multinomial statistical classifier and multiclass Receiver Operation Characteristic curves are needed for model calibration and validation. The statistical susceptibility mapping showed good performance in the study area, with an average AUC of 0.867, which is a significant improvement over the heuristic model. The methodology presented can be used for landslide susceptibility mapping in data-scarce environments, not only in the Himalayan region but also in other mountainous areas where there is a lack of data on past landslide occurrences.},

  abstract = {Compiled per-event vertical-displacement observations from 17 paleoseismic sites along the six central segments of the Wasatch fault zone (WFZ) highlight possible biases and trends in displacement along the fault. The displacement data are consistent with a model of characteristic-type slip, but anomalous and variable displacements indicate that significant natural variability in displacement occurs. When combined into a composite distribution of displacement, 79\% of the data fit within a displacement envelope that shows displacement decreasing in a half-ellipse shape from 1.4–3.5 m near the segment centers to 0.6–2.5 m near the ends. Additionally, displacements normalized by the distance from the segment centers to ends decrease from means of 2.0–3.0 m near the segment centers to 1.3–1.9 m near the ends, consistent with characteristic-type slip termination. Although several paleoseismic sites exhibit repeated, similar displacements, the data are sparse and both low-valued (0.5–0.8 m) and high-valued (4.2–4.7 m) outliers suggest complex strain release, possibly resulting from segment interaction and/or noncharacteristic events. Although a global, normal-fault-type surface-rupture-length (SRL) average-displacement regression underpredicts observed WFZ displacements, the largest displacements per segment correspond well with a SRL maximum-displacement regression. This correlation, as well as moderate variability in SRL- and displacement-based moment magnitude, suggests that the anomalous displacements represent the intrinsic variability in characteristic displacement per segment. Thus, minor variations to the characteristic slip model to account for exceptional upper- and lower-bound displacements, e.g., a hybrid characteristic-variable slip model, may be appropriate for the WFZ. Additional paleoseismic data are necessary to address data gaps and biases, to facilitate more robust tests of earthquake-slip models, and to reduce uncertainty in SRL, displacement, and magnitude.},

  abstract = {In 1955, Lane introduced the qualitative expression QwS α QsDs to relate water discharge (Qw), channel slope (S), sediment discharge or load (Qs), and a representative bed sediment size (Ds) for a river reach under dynamic equilibrium conditions. For over 50years, Lane's relation has provided a unique conceptual model useful to engineers, geomorphologists, and educators for visualizing and describing the concept of dynamic equilibrium in rivers. However, the ability of Lane's relation to describe river adjustments is inherently limited because the expression cannot account for the changes in cross-sectional, planform and bedform geometry that are typically associated with complex channel adjustments. By demonstrating that Qs is inversely proportional to the width-to-depth ratio (W/d), we expand Lane's relation to include the width-to-depth ratio as a cross-sectional geometry term: QwS α QsDs (W/d). We further demonstrate that the slope term (S) is proportional to the total change in elevation along a channel (∆z) and inversely proportional to sinuosity (P) and bedform amplitude (H¯a): S α ∆z/(PH¯a). The introduction of the width-to-depth ratio and expressing channel slope in terms of channel geometry expands the original Lane's relation to explicitly include measures of cross-sectional, planform and bedform geometry as additional degrees of freedom. This significantly broadens the usefulness of Lane's original relation as a conceptual model and allows the visualization of complex river responses that commonly involve adjustments to cross-sectional, planform, and/or bedform geometry.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions provide data for evaluating the mechanisms of past, natural climate variability. Geometries of former mountain glaciers, constrained by moraine mapping, afford the opportunity to reconstruct palaeoclimate, due to the close relationship between ice extent and local climate. In this study, we present results from a series of experiments using a 2-D coupled energy balance–ice flow model that investigate the palaeoclimate significance of Last Glacial Maximum moraines within nine catchments in the central North Island, New Zealand. We find that the former ice limits can be simulated when present-day temperatures are reduced by between 4 and 7 °C, if precipitation remains unchanged from present. The spread in the results between the nine catchments is likely to represent the combination of chronological and model uncertainties. The majority of catchments targeted require temperature decreases of 5.1 to 6.3 °C to simulate the former glaciers, which represents our best estimate of the temperature anomaly in the central North Island, New Zealand, during the Last Glacial Maximum. A decrease in precipitation of up to 25 \% from present, as suggested by proxy evidence and climate models, increases the magnitude of the required temperature changes by up to 0.8 °C. Glacier model experiments using reconstructed topographies that exclude the volume of post-glacial ( \&lt; 15 ka) volcanism generally increased the magnitude of cooling required to simulate the former ice limits by up to 0.5 °C. Our palaeotemperature estimates expand the spatial coverage of proxy-based quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions in New Zealand. Our results are also consistent with independent, proximal temperature reconstructions from fossil groundwater and pollen assemblages, as well as similar glacier modelling reconstructions from the central Southern Alps, which suggest air temperatures were ca. 6 °C lower than present across New Zealand during the Last Glacial Maximum.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The 1991 Randa rockslide in the Swiss Alps involved several complex mechanisms relating to geological, mechanical and hydrological processes for which no clear trigger can be asserted. This paper investigates the concept of progressive failure and the numerical modelling of rock mass strength degradation in natural rock slopes using the Randa rockslide as a working example. Results from continuum (i.e. finite-element) modelling are presented to illustrate a hypothesis, suggesting that initiation of a progressive rock mass degradation process, ultimately leading to failure, began following deglaciation of the valley below. Discontinuum (distinct-element) modelling is then applied to investigate the underlying mechanisms contributing to the episodic nature of the rockslide. Finally, the use of a hybrid method that combines both continuum and discontinuum techniques to model fracture propagation are discussed in the context of modelling progressive slide surface development linking initiation and degradation to eventual catastrophic failure.},

  abstract = {In May of 1999, melting snow cover combined with heavy rainfalls in the northeastern part of Switzerland resulted in the occurrence of numerous shallow landslides. Many of these slides were located in the subalpine Molasse, a series of interbedded marls, conglomerates and sandstones. The subalpine Molasse is highly prone to such sliding activity given the dip of bedding, the surface topography and the weak nature of the marls that rapidly degrade when exposed to weathering. Historically, the subalpine Molasse has been the source of numerous slides of varying orders of magnitude and the surficial morphology is primarily dictated by previous rockslides, which periodically reactivate as secondary soil slips. Given the conditions contributing to the slope failure and the history of previous sliding, similar slides within the region are highly probable. This paper presents the findings from a detailed investigation of one such slide, the 1999 Rufi slide. Results from a detailed engineering geological investigation show that the initial rockslide failure plane predominantly developed and passed through the marl beds, as dictated by the penetration of the weathering front into the marls, and not along reactivated shears or the bedding plane contact between the marls and overlying conglomerates. Numerical modelling results based on a coupled hydromechanical distinct-element analysis were able to reproduce this mechanism by incorporating a progressive strength degradation procedure correlated to mapped weathering grades.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The underlying complexity associated with deep-seated rock slope stability problems usually restricts their treatment to phenomenological studies that are largely descriptive and qualitative. Quantitative assessments, when employed, typically focus on assessing the stability state but ignore factors related to the slope’s temporal evolution including rock mass strength degradation, internal shearing, and progressive failure, all of which are key processes contributing to the final collapse of the slope. Reliance on displacement monitoring for early warning and the difficulty in interpreting the data without a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms has led to a situation where predictions are highly variable and generally unreliable. This paper reviews current knowledge regarding prefailure mechanisms of massive rock slopes and current practices used to assess the hazard posed. Advanced numerical modelling results are presented that focus on the importance of stress- and strain-controlled rock mass strength degradation leading to failure initiation. Efforts to address issues related to parameter and model uncertainty are discussed in the context of a high alpine research facility, the ‘‘Randa In Situ Rockslide Laboratory’’, where state-of-the-art instrumentation systems and numerical modelling are being used to better understand the mechanisms controlling prefailure deformations over time and their evolution leading to catastrophic failure.},

  abstract = {Local reactivations of landslides in forests are rarely reported in landslide catalogues. The occurrence of hillslope sections with fresh morphological landslide features in forested old, deep-seated landslides, however, suggests that landslide reactivations are not restricted to residential areas. In this study, a dendrogeomorphological analysis of beech stands was used to investigate the periods of reactivation of a deep-seated rotational slide in the Koppenberg forest (Flemish Ardennes, Belgium). The relation to rainfall and the correspondence to landslide reactivations reported in a nearby built-up area were also analysed. A dendrometrical study preceding the dendrochronological analysis proved that, compared with the nearby reference site, trees on the Koppenberg forest landslide site were significantly more inclined and showed more knees, indicating that the landslide site has not stabilized yet. As the sampled trees are younger than the landslide, dendrochronology did not allow determination of the year in which the landslide was initiated, but analysis of two different tree ring width parameters (i.e. ring eccentricity and growth change) calculated for trees sampled on the Koppenberg landslide and the reference site proved to be of great help in determining the temporal sequence of landslide reactivation. During the past 80 years, several periods indicative of local reactivations (i.e. 1943–1945, 1949–1952, 1967–1970, 1972–1977, 1979–1981, 1988–1997) were found within the investigated landslide, but delineation of the spatial extent of the reactivations during these indicative periods was not straightforward. These periods generally correspond to years with above-average rainfall. Finally, the fact that at least 34\% of the years indicative of reactivation of the Koppenberg forest landslide correspond to a year in which a landslide reactivation was reported in the Flemish Ardennes suggests that in built-up areas, apart from anthropogenic interventions, natural triggering factors remain very important.

  abstract = {Large, deep-seated landslides are common features in the Flemish Ardennes (Belgium). As most of these old ({$>$}100 years) landslides are located under forest in this hilly region, aerial photograph interpretation is not an appropriate landslide mapping method. This study tested the potential of LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) images for mapping old landslides under forest. Landslide inventory maps were created for a 125 km2 area by applying the expert knowledge of seven geomorphologists to LIDAR-derived hillshade, slope and contour line maps in a GIS environment. Each of the seven LIDAR-based landslide inventories was compared (i) with the other six, (ii) with a detailed field survey-based inventory, and (iii) with a comparable study in which topographic data were extracted from a topographical map. The combination of the percentage of field landslides indicated by an expert and the percentage of positional discrepancies (expressed in terms of positional mismatch) were used to evaluate the quality of the LIDAR-based inventory maps. High-quality LIDAR-derived landslide inventory maps contain more than 70 per cent of the landslides mapped during the field survey, and have positional discrepancies smaller than 70 per cent when compared with the field survey-based inventory map. Four experts and the combination map of all experts satisfied these criteria. Together the seven experts indicated all landslides mapped in the field. Importantly, LIDAR enabled the experts to find ten new landslides and to correct the boundaries of eleven (of the 77) landslides mapped during the field survey. Hence, this study showed that large-scale LIDAR-derived maps analysed by experienced geomorphologists can significantly improve field survey-based inventories of landslides with a subdued morphology in hilly regions.

  abstract = {This paper presents a robust approach using artificial neural networks in the form of a Self Organizing Map (SOM) as a semi-automatic method for analysis and identification of morphometric features in two completely different environments, the Man and Biosphere Reserve “Eastern Carpathians” (Central Europe) in a complex mountainous humid area and Yardangs in Lut Desert, Iran, a hyper arid region characterized by homogeneous repetition of wind-eroded landforms. The NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) has provided Digital Elevation Models (DEM) for over 80\% of the land surface. Version 3.0 SRTM data provided by the CGIAR-CSI GeoPortal are the result of substantial editing effort on the SRTM DEM produced by NASA. Easy availability of SRTM 3 arc second data promoted great advances in morphometric studies and numerical description of terrain surface features as shown by many literature references. The goal of this study was to develop a new semi-automatic DEM-based method for geo-morphometric feature recognition and to explore the potential and limitation of SRTM 90 meter data in such studies. The 3 arc seconds data were re-projected to a 90 m UTM grid. Bivariate quadratic surfaces with moving window size of 5×5 were fitted to this DEM. The first derivative, slope steepness and the second derivatives minimum curvature, maximum curvature and crosssectional curvature were calculated as geo-morphometric parameters and were used as input to the SOMs. Different learning parameter setting, e.g. initial radius, final radius, number of iterations, and the effect of the random initial weights on average quantization error were investigated. A SOM with a low average quantization error was used for further analysis. Feature space analysis, morphometric signatures, three-dimensional inspection and auxiliary data facilitated the assignment of semantic meaning to the output classes in terms of geo-morphometric features. Results are provided in a geographic information system as thematic maps of landform entities based on form and slope. Geo-morphometric features are scale-dependent and the resolution of the DEM limits the information, which can be derived. The results demonstrate that a SOM is an efficient scalable tool for analyzing geo-morphometric features as meaningful landforms under diverse environmental conditions. This method provides additional information for geomorphologic and landscape analysis even in inaccessible regions and uses the full potential of morphometric characteristics.},

The several different finite and incremental methods of representing deformation paths are connected by matrix algebra, and graphical presentation in natural strain space is found to be particularly clear. New methods permit calculation of various components of deformation paths from boudinage, pressure shadows, and inclusion trails in naturally deformed metamorphic rocks. In coaxially accumulating deformation paths the principal strains remain parallel to the same material lines in the rock and have been referred to inappropriately as irrotational. Straight inclusion trails in metamorphic minerals may be produced by synkinematic grain growth during a coaxially accumulating path and do not necessarily indicate postkinematic grain growth. Synkinematic inclusion trails can be produced by growth of the grain through its pressure shadow rather than matrix schistosity, and the quartz protected from recrystallization by being included in snowball garnets may sometimes form this way.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the authors review recent applications of an integrated numerical modeling approach based on the analysis of the mechanical behavior of discrete systems. The numerical analysis includes both a more realistic representation of fracture networks and the simulation of rock mass behavior as a combination of failure through intact rock and displacement/rotation along predefined discontinuities. Selected examples are presented with respect to a variety of engineering problems, including shear testing, failure of hard-rock pillars, slope stability, and block/panel cave mining. The results clearly illustrate the importance of including natural jointing to better capture rock mass behavior in response to loading and unloading. Particular emphasis is given to modeling cave development and surface subsidence, and the proposed numerical method is shown to capture fully the complex rock mass response to caving associated with multi lift extraction. Whereas the use of relatively complex numerical models is progressively becoming widespread in industry, this paper also reviews how numerical simulations of rock mass behavior strongly depends on the geological assumptions used to build the underlying discrete fracture network model and the mechanical properties of the natural discontinuities. Accordingly, a correct balance among engineering judgment, field characterization, and numerical modeling should always be maintained to reduce model uncertainty.

  abstract = {10Be exposure age chronology of the last glaciation was established in a key area at the southern slopes of the High Tatra Mts., Western Carpathians. In-situ produced 10Be in moraine boulders, glacially transformed bedrock surfaces and rockfall accumulations constrains the timing of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) glacier expansion and provides chronological evidence for the post-LGM decay of one of the largest paleoglaciers in the range. The uncertainty-weighted mean age of 22.0~±~0.8~ka obtained for the terminal moraine in the forefield of the Velká Studená dolina Valley indicates that the oldest moraine was deposited close to the global LGM. This finding confirms that well-preserved moraines in the range were formed during the last glacial cycle and that glaciation on the southern flank of the range was more extensive than earlier in the last glacial cycle. The maximum glacier extent correlates with late Würmian/Weichselian glacier phases in the Alps, the Bavarian/Bohemian Forest and the Krkonoše Mts., but probably postdates the period of maximum glaciation in the Southern Carpathians. Re-advance moraines at the mouth of the Velká Studená dolina Valley and in the middle part of the Malá Studená dolina Valley were deposited no later than around 20.5~ka and 15.5~ka, respectively. The timing of these advances is broadly synchronous within the High Tatra Mts. as well as with glacier advances in the Alps, Bavarian/Bohemian Forest and Krkonoše Mts. 10Be exposure ages obtained from glacially transformed bedrock surfaces range between 20.5~±~1.7~ka and 10.7~±~0.3~ka constraining the onset and the final phase of the deglaciation. Surface exposure dating of four rockfall accumulations produced uncertainty-weighted mean ages of 20.2~±~1.2~ka, 17.0~±~0.7~ka, 16.5~±~0.4~ka and 15.6~±~0.7~ka. These ages indicate that activation of rock-slope failures occurred under paraglacial conditions within a few centuries up to 1400 years after the formation of re-advance moraines.},

  abstract = {This research illustrates the case of a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) affecting a folded structure that developed during Miocene tectonics in the Northern Apennines of Italy, deforming a heterogeneous turbiditic sequence characterised by pelitic-marly and arenaceous intervals. The investigated area includes the headwater portion of the Bidente River basin that has experienced intensive valley incision during the late Quaternary and the sizeable Poggio Baldi landslide with failure episodes in 1914 and 2010. The aim of this work was to unravel the local morphostructural setting determined by the interplay between the active DSGSD, inherited fold geometry, and fluvial dynamics. Dip data collection and structural analysis were used to reconstruct the fold geometry. A complex type of fault-propagation fold was outlined, with later breakthrough thrusts causing the backlimb rotation. Gravity-driven geomorphological features were inventoried and displayed on two geological cross-sections together with Geological Strength Index measurements, while their distribution was analysed to conceive a conceptual model for the development of the DSGSD. Fold setting and lithological anisotropies were considered as the predisposing factors of the gravitational slope deformation, whereas the multi-step entrenchment of the Bidente River valley, testified by the presence of the remnants of at least three generations of fluvial erosional terraces, was considered as the main cause of its initiation. Finally, the reconstruction of the original slope topography in the Poggio Baldi area and the results of structural analysis performed in the landslide detachment zone through remote sensing techniques allowed for the estimation of the size of the wedge-shaped rock block which detached in 1914, an event that occurred in the wider frame of the DSGSD.},

  abstract = {In terrestrial high-latitude regions, observations indicate recent changes in snow cover, permafrost, and soil freeze–thaw transitions due to climate change. These modifications may result in temporal shifts in the growing season and the associated rates of terrestrial productivity. Changes in productivity will influence the ability of these ecosystems to sequester atmospheric CO2. We use the terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM), which simulates the soil thermal regime, in addition to terrestrial carbon (C), nitrogen and water dynamics, to explore these issues over the years 1960–2100 in extratropical regions (30–901N). Our model simulations show decreases in snow cover and permafrost stability from 1960 to 2100. Decreases in snow cover agree well with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite observations collected between the years 1972 and 2000, with Pearson rank correlation coefficients between 0.58 and 0.65. Model analyses also indicate a trend towards an earlier thaw date of frozen soils and the onset of the growing season in the spring by approximately 2–4 days from 1988 to 2000. Between 1988 and 2000, satellite records yield a slightly stronger trend in thaw and the onset of the growing season, averaging between 5 and 8 days earlier. In both, the TEM simulations and satellite records, trends in day of freeze in the autumn are weaker, such that overall increases in growing season length are due primarily to earlier thaw. Although regions with the longest snow cover duration displayed the greatest increase in growing season length, these regions maintained smaller increases in productivity and heterotrophic respiration than those regions with shorter duration of snow cover and less of an increase in growing season length. Concurrent with increases in growing season length, we found a reduction in soil C and increases in vegetation C, with greatest losses of soil C occurring in those areas with more vegetation, but simulations also suggest that this trend could reverse in the future. Our results reveal noteworthy changes in snow, permafrost, growing season length, productivity, and net C uptake, indicating that prediction of terrestrial C dynamics from one decade to the next will require that large-scale models adequately take into account the corresponding changes in soil thermal regimes.},

  abstract = {Potentially destructive earthquakes are inevitable in the Los Angeles region of California, but hazards prediction can provide a basis for reducing damage and loss. This volume identifies the principal geologically controlled earthquake hazards of the region (surface faulting, strong shaking, ground failure, and tsunamis), summarizes methods for characterizing their extent and severity, and suggests opportunities for their reduction. Two systems of active faults generate earthquakes in the Los Angeles region: northwest-trending, chiefly horizontal-slip faults, such as the San Andreas, and west-trending, chiefly vertical-slip faults, such as those of the Transverse Ranges. Faults in these two systems have produced more than 40 damaging earthquakes since 1800. Ninety-five faults have slipped in late Quaternary time (approximately the past 750,000 yr) and are judged capable of generating future moderate to large earthquakes and displacing the ground surface. Average rates of late Quaternary slip or separation along these faults provide an index of their relative activity. The San Andreas and San Jacinto faults have slip rates measured in tens of millimeters per year, but most other faults have rates of about 1 mm/yr or less. Intermediate rates of as much as 6 mm/yr characterize a belt of Transverse Ranges faults that extends from near Santa Barbara to near San Bernardino. The dimensions of late Quaternary faults provide a basis for estimating the maximum sizes of likely future earthquakes in the Los Angeles region: moment magnitude .(M) 8 for the San Andreas, M 7 for the other northwest-trending elements of that fault system, and M 7.5 for the Transverse Ranges faults. Geologic and seismologic evidence along these faults, however, suggests that, for planning and designing noncritical facilities, appropriate sizes would be M 8 for the San Andreas, M 7 for the San Jacinto, M 6.5 for other northwest-trending faults, and M 6.5 to 7 for the Transverse Ranges faults. The geologic and seismologic record indicates that parts of the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults have generated major earthquakes having recurrence intervals of several tens to a few hundred years. In contrast, the geologic evidence at points along other active faults suggests recurrence intervals measured in many hundreds to several thousands of years. The distribution and character of late Quaternary surface faulting permit estimation of the likely location, style, and amount of future surface displacements. An extensive body of geologic and geotechnical information is used to evaluate areal differences in future levels of shaking. Bedrock and alluvial deposits are differentiated according to the physical properties that control shaking response; maps of these properties are prepared by analyzing existing geologic and soils maps, the geomorphology of surficial units, and. geotechnical data obtained from boreholes. The shear-wave velocities of near-surface geologic units must be estimated for some},

These data are used in reconstructions of patterns of glacier recession since the Little Ice Age maximum, and the geomorphic signals of climatic versus non-climatic events are discussed. Age control was obtained from various dated substrates by utilizing historical accounts, aerial photographs and grave stones. Three lichen growth rates are calculated: (a) 0.51 mm a\textbackslash{}  (corrected to 0.50 mm a\textbackslash{} ) with a colonization lag time of (16 yr for the arid forelands of north Vatnajo¨ kull; (b) 0.56 mm a\textbackslash{}  with a colonization lag time of 5 yr for the Icelandic southeast coast; and (c) 0.80 mm a\textbackslash{}  with a colonization lag time of 6.5 yr for the south Vatnajo¨ kull and east My´ rdalsjo¨ kull forelands. These compare favourably with a previously published growth rate of 0.44 mm a\textbackslash{}  for the arid north of Iceland. This regional coverage of data allows a comparison between annual precipitation totals and lichen growth rates and the construction of a growth rate prediction curve for Iceland. The success of the Schmidt hammer in differentiating moraines based upon age varied according to the geomorphological setting. Reasonable R-value/lichen size correlations were obtained on the east My´ rdalsjo¨ kull and Heinabergsjo¨ kull forelands where unrestricted glacier advance into lowlands allows for a higher degree of debris surface freshening by direct glacial processes. Weak correlations were obtained at Kvı´ a´ rjo¨ kull, where the glacier was restricted by a precursor latero-frontal moraine loop and therefore the debris comprising the Little Ice Age recessional moraines was diluted with material of various ages being reworked by mass movement from the precursor moraine loop. Similar problems arise in areas affected by surging glaciers, such as Bru´ a´ rjo¨ kull and Eyjabakkajo¨ kull. It appears that an accurate R-value age-prediction curve can not be constructed for a timescale of (100 yr in Iceland. 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Starting from a concept of the land surface, its definition and subdivision from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) is considered. High-resolution DEMs from active remote sensing form a new basis for geomorphological work, which is moving on from consideration of whether data are accurate enough to how the surface of interest can be defined from an overabundance of data. Discussion of the operational definition and delimitation of specific landforms of varying degrees of difficulty, from craters to mountains, is followed by the applicability of ‘fuzzy’ boundaries. Scaling, usually allometric, is shown to be compatible with the scale-specificity of many landforms: this is exemplified by glacial cirques and drumlins. Classification of a whole land surface is more difficult than extraction of specific landforms from it. Well-dissected fluvial landscapes pose great challenges for areal analyses. These are tackled by the delimitation of homogeneous elementary forms and/or land elements in which slope position is considered. The boundaries are mainly breaks in gradient or aspect, but may also be in some type of curvature: breaks in altitude are rare. Elementary forms or land elements are grouped together into functional regions (landforms) such as ‘hill sheds’. It may often be useful to recognise fuzziness of membership, or core and periphery of a surface object.},

  abstract = {Climatic warming during the last 100-150 years has resulted in a significant glacier ice loss from mountainous areas of the world. Certain natural processes which pose hazards to people and development in these areas have accelerated as a result of this recent deglaciation. These include glacier avalanches, landslides and slope instability caused by glacier debuttressing, and outburst floods from moraine- and glacier-dammed lakes. In addition, changes in sediment and water supply induced by climatic warming and glacier retreat have altered channel and floodplain patterns of rivers draining high mountain ranges. The perturbation of natural processes operating in mountain environments, caused by recent climatic warming, ranges from tens of decades for moraine-dam failures to hundreds of years or more for landslides. The recognition that climatic change as modest as that of the last century can perturb natural alpine processes has important implications for hazard assessment and future development in mountains. Even so, these effects are probably at least an order of magnitude smaller than those associated with late Pleistocene deglaciation ca. 15,000 to 10,000 years ago. © 1994.},

Water for fluidization of the entrained material originated in the melting of incorporated snow and the liberation of soil moisture contained within the entrained materials. Eyewitness reports indicate very high mean velocities for the events; 17–35 m/s (1962) and 50–85 m/s (1970). The runout distances and velocity profiles of both events were simulated using DAN/W. Both mass movements continued downstream in the Rio Santa as debris floods (aluviones) that in 1970 reached the Pacific at a distance of 180 km. In strong contrast to publications in the geosciences literature, 1961 Peru Census data indicates that the death toll of the 1970 event is ca. 6000 and that total life loss in the two events did not exceed 7000 people.},

The depth-age models of the cores were constructed using 210Pb and 137Cs activity according to the constant rate of supply (CRS) model. The lake sediment cover of these lakes began to form ca. 1840. We defined three periods of increased permafrost thawing during the last 170 years. The first maximum of permafrost melting occurred from 1870 to 1880, the second episode was from 1900 to 1930 and the third began between 1960 and 1965. During these periods, the maxima of permafrost melting occurred with a specific time lag following.},

  abstract = {Two rock avalanches in Troms County - the Grøtlandsura and Russenes - were selected as CRONUS-EU natural cosmogenic 10Be production-rate calibration sites because they (a) preserve large boulders that have been continuously exposed to cosmic irradiation since their emplacement; (b) contain boulders with abundant quartz phenocrysts and veins with low concentrations of naturally-occurring 9Be (typically{$<$}1.5ppb); and (c) have reliable minimum radiocarbon ages of 11,424±108calyr BP and 10,942±77calyr BP (1σ), respectively. Quartz samples (n=6) from these two sites contained between 4.28×104 and 5.06×104 at 10Be/g using the 1.387Myr 10Be half-life. Determination of these concentrations accounts for topographic and self-shielding, and effects on nuclide production due to isostatic rebound are shown to be negligible. Persistent, constant snow and moss cover cannot be proven, but if taken into consideration they may have reduced 10Be concentrations by 10\%. Using the 10Be half-life of 1.387Myr and the Stone scaling scheme, and accounting for snow- and moss-cover, we calculate an error-weighted mean total 10Be production rate of 4.12±0.19 at/g/yr (1σ). A corresponding error-weighted mean spallogenic 10Be production rate is 3.96±0.16 at/g/yr (1σ), respectively. These are in agreement within uncertainty with other 10Be production rates in the literature, but are significantly, statistically lower than the global average 10Be production rate. This research indicates, like other recent studies, that the production of cosmogenic 10Be in quartz is lower than previously established by other production-rate calibration projects. Similarly, our findings indicate that regional cosmogenic production rates should be used for determining exposure ages of landforms in order to increase the accuracy of those ages. As such, using the total 10Be production rate from our study, we determine an error-weighted mean surface-exposure age of a third rock avalanche in Troms County (the Hølen avalanche) to be 7.5±0.3kyr (1σ). This age suggests that the rock avalanche occurred shortly after the 8.2kyr cooling event, just as the radiocarbon ages of the Grøtlandsura and Russenes avalanches confirm field evidence that those rock-slope failures occurred shortly after deglaciation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Landslides are common features in the Serra do Mar, located along the southeastern Brazilian coast, most of them associated with intense summer storms, specially on the soil-mantled steep hillslopes around Rio de Janeiro city, where the favelas (slums) proliferated during the last few decades. On February 1996, hundreds of landslides took place in city of Rio de Janeiro triggered by intense rainstorms. Since then, many studies have been carried out in two experimental river basins in order to investigate the role played by the topographic attributes in controlling the spatial distribution of landslides inside them. Landslide scars and vegetation cover were mapped using aerial photographs and field observations. A detailed digital terrain model (4 m2 resolution) of the basins was generated from which the main topographic attributes were analyzed, producing maps for slope, hillslope form, contributing area and hillslope orientation. By comparing these maps with the spatial distribution of the landslide scars for the 1996 event, a landslide potential index (LPI) for the many classes of the different topographic attributes was defined. At the same time, field experiments with the Guelph permeameter were carried out and a variety of scenarios were simulated with the SHALSTAB model, a process-based mathematical model for the topographic control on shallow landslides. The results suggest that most of the landslides triggered in the studied basins were strongly influenced by topography, while vegetation cover did affect landslide distribution. Between the topographic attributes, hillslope form and contributing area played a major role in controlling the spatial distribution of landslides. Therefore, any procedure to be used in this environment towards the definition of landslide hazards need to incorporate these topographic attributes.},

The long-lived crustal León Fault runs along its western hillslope, and its trace is partially covered by multiple rock-avalanches. Here we discuss if recurrent paleo-earthquakes in the M6+ range could have acted as the triggering factor for rock-avalanches in a region where the historical and instrumental seismic records only include seismic events up to Ms 4.6. Evidence concurring with a coseismic origin includes: (i) kinematic of current minor transverse and parallel faults to Sierra de la Sobia being consistent with a horizontal North-South compression of the Cantabrian Arc; (ii) slopes of the depletion zones that would become unstable if horizontal seismic ground rose 0.10–0.15\,g; and (iii) block size-reduction by dynamic fragmentation creating block size distribution with fractal dimension, ranging between 2.24 and 2.70. U/Th dating of seven calcite precipitates coating the blocks of cemented rock-avalanche deposits suggesting that cementation has taken place in multiple episodes since MIS-9a. Neotectonics of Sierra de la Sobia are expressed in subtle changes in relief after extremely rapid co-seismic events, with average recurrence intervals much longer than the time covered by the regional historical and instrumental period.},

  abstract = {We tested the possibility of using digital, color aerial ortho-photographs and monoscopic, panchromatic satellite images of comparable spatial and radiometric resolution, to map recent landslides in Italy and to update existing measures of landslide mobilization. In a 90-km2 area in Umbria, central Apennines, rainfall resulted in abundant landslides in the period from September 2004 to June 2005. Analysis of the rainfall record determined the approximate dates of landslide occurrence and revealed that the slope failures occurred in response to moderately wet rainfall periods. The slope failures occurred primarily in cultivated terrain and left subtle morphological and land cover signatures, making the recognition and mapping of the individual landslides problematic. Despite the difficulty with the identification of the landslides without the use of stereoscopic visualization, visual analysis of the aerial and satellite images allowed mapping 457 new landslides, ranging in area 3.0 × 101 b AL b 2.5 × 104 m2, for a total landslide area ALT = 6.92 × 105 m2. To identify the landslides, the investigators adopted the interpretation criteria commonly used to identify and map landslides on aerial photography. The result confirms that monoscopic, very high resolution images taken by airborne and satellite sensors can be used to prepare landslide maps even where slope failures are difficult to detect, provided the imagery has sufficient geometric and radiometric resolutions. The different dates of the aerial (March 2005) and the satellite (June–July 2005) images allowed the temporal segmentation of the landslide information, and studying the statistics of landslide area and volume for different periods. Compared to pre-existing information on the abundance and size of the landslides in the area, the inventory obtained by studying the aerial and satellite images proved more complete. The new mapping showed 145\% more landslides and 85\% more landslide area than a pre-existing reconnaissance inventory. As a result of the improved mapping, the rate of landslide mobilization for the 2004–2005 landslide season was determined to be φL = 27.1 mm year−1, 30\% higher than a previous estimate for the same period. This seasonal rate of landslide mobilization is significantly larger than the long-term regional erosion rate in the central Apennines. The accelerated rate is attributed to agricultural practices that favor slope instability.},

  abstract = {The Tschierva rock avalanche occurred on October 29, 1988 in the area of the Piz Morteratsch, Switzerland. Releasing a total volume of \textasciitilde{} 300,000 m3, the avalanche ran out over 1 km destroying a hiking trail before stopping on the Tschierva Glacier. We analyze the setting of this periglacial slope failure, combining geomechanical and cryosphere investigations to identify the primary factors contributing to the rock avalanche. An approach to slope stability assessment is presented that copes with existing data limitations in an inaccessible alpine terrain. Results from the analyses of morphology, geology, glaciation history, permafrost, hydrology, and meteorological data allowed preliminary inferences to be made regarding the influence of these factors on slope stability. Conceptual kinematic and numerical slope stability modeling critically analyzed the role of kinematic degrees of freedom, glacier retreat, and water infiltration from above the detachment zone. Results highlight the strong influence of discontinuity orientation with respect to the slope face, the role of a fault zone with increased joint density, and long-term progressive development of persistent discontinuities induced by glacier retreat and groundwater loading cycles in leading to the rock avalanche. The role of permafrost could not be clearly assessed, however observations and analyses indicate that permafrost had no dominant influence on the slope failure. Extraordinary precipitation prior to the event is suggested to have played a role in triggering the rock avalanche, especially in combination with observed superficial ice that could have sealed the rock face generating high water pressures. Our results emphasize the importance of analyzing multiple contributing factors when assessing alpine rock slope failures, with careful consideration of data limitations prevailing in such areas.},

Since the end of the Little Ice Age (about 1850), the hanging glaciers and firn fields have retreated continuously. During recent decades, the ice cover of the Monte Rosa east face experienced an accelerated and drastic loss in extent. Some glaciers have completely disappeared. New slope instabilities and detachment zones of gravitational mass movements developed and enhanced rock fall and debris flow activity was observed. This study is based on multidisciplinary investigations and shows that most of the detachment zones of rock fall and debris flows are located in areas, where the surface ice disappeared only recently. Furthermore, most of these detachment zones are located in permafrost zones, for the most part close to the modelled and estimated lower boundary of the regional permafrost distribution. In the view of ongoing or even enhanced atmospheric warming and associated changes it is therefore very likely that the slope instabilities in the Monte Rosa east face will continue to represent a critical hazard source.},

This paper investigates 56 sites with slope failures between 1900 and 2007 in the central European Alps with respect to their geological and topographical settings and zones of possible permafrost degradation and glacial recession. Analyses of the temporal distribution show an increase in frequency within the last decades. A large proportion of the slope failures (60 \%) originated from a relatively small area above 3000 m a.s.l. (i.e. 10 \% of the entire investigation area). This increased proportion of detachment zones above 3000 m a.s.l. is postulated to be a result of a combination of factors, namely a larger proportion of high slope angles, high periglacial weathering due to recent glacier retreat (almost half of the slope failures having occurred in areas with recent deglaciation), and widespread permafrost occurrence. The lithological setting appears to influence volume rather than frequency of a slope failure. However, our analyses show that not only the changes in cryosphere, but also other factors which remain constant over long periods play an important role in slope failures.},

The study was conducted at one of the highest periglacial rock faces in the European Alps, the permafrost-affected and partially glacierised east face of Monte Rosa. Strongly increased rock and ice avalanche activity on this rock wall has caused major topographic change in recent decades. A time series of high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) with a 2-m resolution was produced from digital aerial photogrammetry for 1956, 1988 and 2001 and from airborne LiDAR for 2005 and 2007. The DTM comparisons reveal a total volume loss of permafrost-affected bedrock and glacier ice of more than 20 Â 106 m3 over the past 50 years, with the majority of the loss since 1988. Analysis of all unstable areas and detachment zones showed that the sequence of the main slope failures is spatially connected and that there is coupling between permafrost bedrock instability and the condition of adjacent hanging glaciers.

There are, however, areas with signi"cant deviations between uplift measurements and regional model predictions. The mis"t between observations and the isostatic uplift modelling is interpreted here to re\#ect a tectonic component of the uplift. The objective of the present investigation is to isolate this tectonic uplift component. Interestingly enough, the areas found partly correspond to areas with pronounced seismic activity, and the assumption that the postglacial rebound is responsible for much of the observed onshore seismicity is substantiated.},

  abstract = {Large landslides are bounded on their flanks and on elements within the landslides by structures analogous to strike-slip faults. We observed the formation of thwse strike-slip faults and associated structures at two large landslides in central Utah during 1983-1985. The strike-slip faults in landslides are nearly vertical but locally may dip a few degrees toward or away from the moving ground. Fault surfaces are slickensided, and striations are subparallel to the ground surface. Displacement along strike-slip faults commonly produces scarps; scarps occur where local relief of the failure surface or ground surface is displaced and becomes adjacent to higher or lower ground, or where the landslide is thickening or thinning as a result of internal deformation. Several types of structures are formed at the ground surface as a strike-slip fault, which is fully developed at some depth below the ground surface, propagates upward in response to displacement. The simplest structure is a tension crack oriented at 45?? clockwise or counterclockwise from the trend of an underlying right- or left-lateral strike-slip fault, respectively. The tension cracks are typically arranged en echelon with the row of cracks parallel to the trace of the underlying strike-slip fault. Another common structure that forms above a developing strike-slip fault is a fault segment. Fault segments are discontinuous strike-slip faults that contain the same sense of slip but are turned clockwise or counterclockwise from a few to perhaps 20?? from the underlying strike-slip fault. The fault segments are slickensided and striated a few centimeters below the ground surface; continued displacement of the landslide causes the fault segments to open and a short tension crack propagates out of one or both ends of the fault segments. These structures, open fault segments containing a short tension crack, are termed compound cracks; and the short tension crack that propagates from the tip of the fault segment is typically oriented 45?? to the trend of the underlying fault. Fault segments are also typically arranged en echelon above the upward-propagating strike-slip fault. Continued displacement of the landslide causes the ground to buckle between the tension crack portions of the compound cracks. Still more displacement produces a thrust fault on one or both limbs of the buckle fold. These compressional structures form at right angles to the short tension cracks at the tips of the fault segments. Thus, the compressional structures are bounded on their ends by one face of a tension crack and detached from underlying material by thrusting or buckling. The tension cracks, fault segments, compound cracks, folds, and thrusts are ephemeral; they are created and destroyed with continuing displacement of the landslide. Ultimately, the structures are replaced by a throughgoing strike-slip fault. At one landslide, we observed the creation and destruction of the ephemeral structures as the landslide enlarged. Displacement of a few centimeters to about a decimeter was sufficient to produce scattered tension cracks and fault segments. Sets of compound cracks with associated folds and thrusts were produced by displacements of up to 1 m, and 1 to 2 m of displacement was required to produce a throughgoing strike-slip fault. The type of first-formed structure above an upward-propagating strike-slip fault is apparently controlled by the rheology of the material. Brittle material such as dry topsoil or the compact surface of a gravel road produces echelon tension cracks and sets of tension cracks and compressional structures, wherein the cracks and compressional structures are normal to each other and 45?? to the strike-slip fault at depth. First-formed structures in more ductile material such as moist cohesive soil are fault segments. In very ductile material such as soft clay and very wet soil in swampy areas, the first-formed structure is a throughgoing strike-slip fault. There are other structures associated with strike-slip faults that are not ephemeral and tend to persist after many meters of displacement. These are extensional and compressional features, which are associated with steps and curves in strike-slip faults, and flank ridges, which form parallel to the strike-slip fault. Extensional structures form where a left- or right-lateral strike-slip fault steps or curves left or right, respectively. We monitored the formation of a pull-apart basin at a right step in a right-lateral strike-slip fault. The first crack formed between and connecting the strike-slip faults is diagonal and trends 45?? to the traces of the faults. The upper few decimeters of the crack surface are rough, irregular, vertical and consistent with formation in tension. Below the tension crack, the surface dips downslope at about 60?? and is slickensided and striated. The azimuth of the striations is parallel to the trend of the strike-slip faults but oblique to the diagonal fault surface. Thus, the upper part of the diagonal crack is a tension crack with an orientation consistent with published models for stresses that produce such cracks, but the lower part is an oblique-slip fault produced by displacement along the strike-slip faults upslope and downslope from the step. With continuing displacement, the diagonal crack is replaced by newly formed normal faults that are at right angles to strike-slip faults. The pull-apart basin becomes bounded on the uphill and downhill ends by normal faults, on one side by a strike-slip fault surface, and on the side within the moving ground by a monoclinal flexure. The monoclinal flexure develops a thrust fault at its hinge line where landslide debris moves laterally toward the basin. Compressional structures such as thrusts, folds and domes form where, for example, a left-lateral strike-slip fault steps right. These structures are similar to the small folds and thrusts formed between the ends of compound cracks, but they are much larger and tend to persist after many meters of landslide displacement. They apparently occur where segments of the upward-propagating strike-slip fault are grossly misaligned. The domes and folds occur within moving landslide debris. The thrust faults may result in displacement of landslide debris over adjacent, unfailed material. Flank ridges, which form parallel to a strike-slip fault, are up to several meters high, 1 to 3 decameters wide, and several decameters long. We recognized two fundamentally different types of flank ridges. One type, a depositinal flank ridge, forms on the outside of the strike-slip fault as a result of material spilling or being thrust over unfailed material. The other type, a deformational flank ridge, forms within the landslide debris, adjacent and parallel to the strike-slip fault. Some of the deformational ridges we examined contained intrusions and extrusions of highly plastic clay from deep within the landslide. At one flank-ridge site, the clay had been injected into the strike-slip fault as a tabular wedge and into adjoining landslide debris as anastomosing veins. Measurement of the growth of a ridge revealed that the crest of the ridge rises relative to adjacent material that is moving downhill as a result of displacement. Strain measurements revealed tension at the crest of the ridge and compression on the flank of the ridge but virtually no net strain accumulated across the entire cross section of a growing ridge. Therefore, the ridge cannot be the result of simple compression necessary for buckle folding. Field evidence for actively growing ridges includes tension cracks at the ridge crest, which are oriented oblique to the trend of the ridge, and small folds, which form around the downslope end and lower flank of a growing ridge. Indirect evidence for active ridge growth includes rupture of the ridge crest with exposure of fresh landslide debris and tilted trees. ?? 1989.},

  abstract = {Geomorphometry is widely used to solve various multiscale geoscientific problems. For the successful application of geomorphometric methods, a researcher should know the basic mathematical concepts of geomorphometry and be aware of the system of morphometric variables, as well as understand their physical, mathematical and geographical meanings. This paper reviews the basic mathematical concepts of general geomorphometry. First, we discuss the notion of the topographic surface and its limitations. Second, we present definitions, formulae and meanings for four main groups of morphometric variables, such as local, non-local, two-field specific and combined topographic attributes, and we review the following 29 fundamental morphometric variables: slope, aspect, northwardness, eastwardness, plan curvature, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, difference curvature, horizontal excess curvature, vertical excess curvature, accumulation curvature, ring curvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, unsphericity curvature, rotor, Laplacian, shape index, curvedness, horizontal curvature deflection, vertical curvature deflection, catchment area, dispersive area, reflectance, insolation, topographic index and stream power index. For illustrations, we use a digital elevation model (DEM) of Mount Ararat, extracted from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 1-arc-second DEM. The DEM was treated by a spectral analytical method. Finally, we briefly discuss the main paradox of general geomorphometry associated with the smoothness of the topographic surface and the non-smoothness of the real topography; application of morphometric variables; statistical aspects of geomorphometric modelling, including relationships between morphometric variables and roughness indices; and some pending problems of general geomorphometry (i.e. analysis of inner surfaces of caves, analytical description of non-local attributes and structural lines, as well as modelling on a triaxial ellipsoid). The paper can be used as a reference guide on general geomorphometry.},

Detailed mapping into a GIS and compilation of two slide inventories in Walker Creek, Marin County, reflect erosional effects of storms occurring in 1941 and 1998, respectively. We focus on the spatial distribution and area of slides to illustrate that during both periods slides originate mainly from hillslopes underlain by Franciscan Complex units with slopes ranging from \textasciitilde 10 to 40\%. The majority of slides (\textasciitilde 70\%) have areas ranging between 100 and 1000 m2. The magnitude–frequency distribution of slides represented by the PDF produces a curve that has a linear portion representing the relatively large slides. The power functions of the linear portion of these curves have exponents of about −2.0 for both inventories. Results suggest that the storm event-based PDF of landslide area developed using historical aerial images is a viable means of quantifying the landslide magnitude–frequency relationship at the scale of a small watershed.},

  abstract = {Computer-based geomorphometry using a DEM (Digital Elevation Model) allows the analysis of the threedimensional properties of landscape. This methodology is particularly useful in an intraplate region like western Europe where the simple visual inspection of the topography cannot resolve the evolutionary trends of landforms. In these domains, the morphologies of the topographic surface may be controlled mainly by climate under a low rate of tectonic deformation. Among the geomorphometric parameters, the stream length index (SL) has been used to characterize fluvial systems in relation to tectonics movements. This work develops an algorithm to derive and map the SL index using a DEM and GIS, to investigate its spatial variations in a broad area. The algorithm is applied to a zone of weak intraplate deformation: the coastal lowlands of Normandy (France). The obtained spatial distributions of SL point to anomalous zones with high SL values. These zones are adjacent to mapped fault scarps and characterized by changes in flow direction. A Kruskal–Wallis test shows that the bedrock lithology has no impact on the SL value. Therefore, the SL variations can be related mainly to a differential uplift due to Quaternary tectonic forcing. Quaternary sea level fluctuations may also be responsible for high SL values in a part of the coastal lowland.},

  abstract = {10Be concentrations in stream sediments are commonly employed to calculate basin-averaged denudation rates. Such calculations assume that denudation is steady in time and that quartz is uniformly distributed in the watershed. The 10Be concentrations in stream sediments are assumed to represent a spatially and temporally averaged concentration, and therefore should not be affected by a discrete erosion event. The effect of such events on 10Be concentrations has been modeled, but has not been previously field-tested following a large precipitation event. In this study, we resampled stream sediments that had been previously analyzed to deduce basin averaged erosion rates in small, tributary basins in the Colorado Front Range following an extreme precipitation event in 2013. Most of our sample sites show no significant change between pre- and post-flood concentrations, and hence no change in the denudation rates inferred from them. The sample locations include a partially burned site, a debris flow site, and sites with very small drainage areas. A notable exception exists at lower Gordon Gulch, within the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory; here, local 10Be data indicate that a large portion of flood-deposited sediment is likely derived from deep soils in fans, terraces, and fills, that are predominantly located on the north-facing toe slope. Overall, the reproducibility of denudation rates deduced from pre- and post-storm samples indicates that the uncertainty associated with 10Be-derived denudation rates is likely less than 15\% in this setting.},

We have simulated a model permafrost system in the temperature range associated with discontinuous permafrost focusing on interactions between permafrost and hydrology using a non-isothermal, three-phase model of water migration coupled to heat transport in partially frozen porous media. We explore the subsurface hydraulic property controls on the formation and dynamics of permafrost, and how this impacts seasonal variability of subsurface runoff to surface waters. For all subsurface conditions considered, the main common hydrological signal of permafrost degradation in a warming trend is decreasing seasonal variability of water flow. This is due to deeper and longer flow pathways with increasing lag times from infiltration or thawing through subsurface flow to surface water discharge. These results show how physically based numerical modelling can be used to quantitatively and qualitatively improve the understanding of how permafrost thawing relates to, and may be detected in, hydrological data. This is advantageous since hydrological data is considerably easier to obtain, may be available in longer time series, and generally reflects larger-scale conditions than direct permafrost observations.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic thresholds for triggering shallow landslides by rainfall are developed using two approaches: a logistic regression model and Iverson’s physically based model. Both approaches are applied to a 180 km2 area in northern Italy. For the physically based model a Monte Carlo approach is used to obtain probabilities of slope failure associated with differing combinations of rainfall intensity and duration as well as differing topographic settings. For the logistic regression model hourly and daily rainfall data and split-sample testing are used to explore the effect of antecedent rainfall on triggering thresholds. It is demonstrated that both the statistical and physically based models provide stochastic thresholds that express the probability of landslide triggering. The resulting thresholds are comparable, even though the two approaches are conceptually different. The physically based model also provides an estimate of the percentage of potentially unstable areas in which failure can be triggered with a certain probability. The return period of rainfall responsible for landslide triggering is studied by using a Gumbel scaling model of rainfall intensity–duration–frequency curves. It is demonstrated that antecedent rainfall must be taken into account in landslide forecasting, and a method is proposed to correct the rainfall return period by filtering the rainfall maxima with a fixed threshold of antecedent rainfall. This correction produces an increase of the return periods, especially for rainstorms of short duration. Copyright  2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {It has been observed that landslide size distribution shows power-law scaling for large landslide areas, with a roll-over for landslides below a certain threshold which frequently coincides with the modal peak of the distribution. The physical reasons leading to this distribution are not yet fully understood. The analysis of non-cumulative size distribution of two landslide inventories in the Italian Alps confirms the existence of a power-law scaling with exponent of 2.56 7 0.02, and demonstrates that the roll-over is not due to under-sampling since it occurs at landslide sizes significantly larger than mapping resolution. The control of topography on landslide size distribution is investigated by a topographic analysis using the virtual tiling method. We observe a power-law scaling of topography with a roll-over for finer scales, which is comparable with that of landslide size distribution. The control of material properties on landslide size and geometry is examined through deterministic and probabilistic 2D limit-equilibrium slope stability analyses. Incoherent materials favour shallow landslides with no limitation in size; cohesive materials favour deep landslides and show a limitation for small sizes. Multilayered materials with depth-dependent strength show a limitation for both small and large landslides.},

  abstract = {We present Bedmap2, a new suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic south of 60◦ S. We derived these products using data from a variety of sources, including many substantial surveys completed since the original Bedmap compilation (Bedmap1) in 2001. In particular, the Bedmap2 ice thickness grid is made from 25 million measurements, over two orders of magnitude more than were used in Bedmap1. In most parts of Antarctica the subglacial landscape is visible in much greater detail than was previously available and the improved datacoverage has in many areas revealed the full scale of mountain ranges, valleys, basins and troughs, only fragments of which were previously indicated in local surveys. The derived statistics for Bedmap2 show that the volume of ice contained in the Antarctic ice sheet (27 million km3) and its potential contribution to sea-level rise (58 m) are similar to those of Bedmap1, but the mean thickness of the ice sheet is 4.6 \% greater, the mean depth of the bed beneath the grounded ice sheet is 72 m lower and the area of ice sheet grounded on bed below sea level is increased by 10 \%. The Bedmap2 compilation highlights several areas beneath the ice sheet where the bed elevation is substantially lower than the deepest bed indicated by Bedmap1. These products, along with grids of data coverage and uncertainty, provide new opportunities for detailed modelling of the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets.},

  abstract = {Landslides are a ubiquitous hazard in terrestrial environments with slopes, incurring human fatalities in urban settlements, along transport corridors and at sites of rural industry. Assessment of landslide risk requires high-quality landslide databases. Recently, global landslide databases have shown the extent to which landslides impact on society and identified areas most at risk. Previous global analysis has focused on rainfall-triggered landslides over short ∼ 5year observation periods. This paper presents spatiotemporal analysis of a global dataset of fatal non-seismic landslides, covering the period from January 2004 to December 2016. The data show that in total 55 997 people were killed in 4862 distinct landslide events. The spatial distribution of landslides is heterogeneous, with Asia representing the dominant geographical area. There are high levels of interannual variation in the occurrence of landslides. Although more active years coincide with recognised patterns of regional rainfall driven by climate anomalies, climate modes (such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation) cannot yet be related to landsliding, requiring a landslide dataset of 30+ years. Our analysis demonstrates that landslide occurrence triggered by human activity is increasing, in particular in relation to construction, illegal mining and hill cutting. This supports notions that human disturbance may be more detrimental to future landslide incidence than climate.},

We collected GPR data along longitudinal and transverse profiles. The longitudinal GPR profiles identify inter-bedded debris-rich layers that dip up-glacier, similar to the thrust structures in the compression zone of a valley glacier. The transverse GPR profiles indicate a syncline structure inclined towards the central part of the rock glacier, resembling the transverse foliation of a valley glacier. The stratigraphy of two boreholes shows that the rock glacier consists primarily of bubbly ice with thin debris-rich layers, an internal structure similar to the ‘nested spoons’ structure common in the interior of valley glaciers. These results indicate that the glacier motion is controlled by shear movement, common in valley glaciers. The geodetic survey confirms that flow velocities decrease towards the lower part of the rock glacier. Such heterogeneous movement causes longitudinal compression and forms thrusts which then create the debris-rich layer by uplifting basal ice and debris. Pushing of the upstream ice against the downstream ice bends the surface layers, forming transverse ridges on the rock glacier surface.},

  abstract = {The shape of soil-mantled hillslopes is typically attributed to erosion rate and the transport efficiency of the various processes that contribute to soil creep. While climate is generally hypothesized to have an important influence on soil creep rates, a lack of uniformity in the measurement of transport efficiency has been an obstacle to evaluating the controls on this important landscape parameter. We addressed this problem by compiling a data set in which the transport efficiency has been calculated using a single method, the analysis of hilltop curvatures using 1-m LiDAR data, and the erosion rates have also been determined via a single method, in-situ cosmogenic 10Be concentrations. Moreover, to control for lithology, we chose sites that are only underlain by resistant bedrock. The sites span a range of erosion rates (6–922 mm/kyr), mean annual precipitation (39–320 cm/yr), and aridity index (0.08–1.38). Surprisingly, we find that hilltop curvature varies with the square root of erosion rate, whereas previous studies predict a linear relationship. In addition, we find that the inferred transport coefficient also varies with the square root of erosion rate but is insensitive to climate. We explore various mechanisms that might link the transport coefficient to the erosion rate and conclude that present theory regarding soil-mantled hillslopes is unable to explain our results and is, therefore, incomplete. Finally, we tentatively suggest that processes occurring in the bedrock (e.g., fracture generation) may play a role in the shape of hillslope profiles at our sites.},

  abstract = {In this study, the strong lithological heterogeneity of the northern Sierra Nevada (California, USA) is exploited to elucidate the role of lithology on river profiles and patterns at the mountain-range scale. The analyses indicate that plutonic, metavolcanic, and quartzite bedrock generally host the steepest river reaches, whereas gentle reaches flow across non-quartzite metasedimentary rocks and fault zones. In addition, the largest immobile boulders are often in the steepest reaches, suggesting that wide joint spacing plays a role in creating steep channels, and a positive relationship between boulder size and hillslope angle highlights the coupling of the hillslope and fluvial systems. With respect to river network configurations, dendritic patterns dominate in the plutonic bedrock, with channels aligned down the slope of the range; in contrast, river reaches in the metamorphic belts are mainly longitudinal and parallel to the structural grain. River profiles and patterns in the northern Sierra Nevada, therefore, bear a strong lithological imprint related to differential erosion. These observations indicate that attempts to infer uplift and tilting of the range based on the gradients and orientations of paleochannel remnants should first account for the effect of bedrock erodibility. Indeed, the differences in gradients of Tertiary paleochannel remnants used to argue for late Cenozoic uplift of the range can be wholly explained by differences in lithology.},

The results show that debris slope ventilation is a common phenomenon occurring in different periods of the year. Its range is influenced mainly by substratum porosity (ground and snow cover), and the difference between the pressure inside and outside this medium (pore and atmospheric air temperature/dense; wind velocity). The height of the slope (‘chimney’) is less important. Some phenomena assumed to be evidences of slope ventilation are often connected with other factors influencing the thermal balance of the ground and the size of snow accumulation.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the influence of climate change on the temperature of a debris slope surface in the zone of sporadic permafrost occurrence in the Tatra Mountains. This involved applications of linear regression equations which describe statistical dependence of the ground surface temperature (GST) upon the current air temperature in snow-free periods, or upon the previous air temperature and snow depth. These equations are validated using the daily air temperature and snow depth at a reference synoptic station and GST at 5 sites located in different topographic conditions. In order to estimate mean winter half-year, mean summer half-year and mean annual GST at these sites in hydrological years 1955–2010, archival meteorological data were used. The maximum errors in these estimations, determined for two reference years, were 0.5 °C, 0.2 °C and 0.1 °C respectively. The results show that the debris slopes thermal sensitivity to climate warming decreases with the increase of: a) shading, 2) altitude, and 3) depth of seasonal snow cover. In general, the changes of the air temperature influence the changes of mean annual ground surface temperature more in snow-free periods than in snow periods, whereas the degradation of orographically conditioned permafrost patches occurs faster in the places where snow cover is thin during the whole winter. The decrease of the depth of a thick snow cover may be accompanied by the decrease of its bottom temperature, despite the increase of the winter air temperature. We infer that in special orographic-nival conditions, the increase of mean annual air temperature may be accompanied by the decrease of mean annual ground surface temperature.},

The balanced cross-section is built on extensive surface and subsurface data and depicts an imbricate fan internally stacked along high-displacement out-of-sequence thrusts. Section restoration yielded 507 km of minimum orogenic shortening — at least \textasciitilde{} 230 km more than proposed in previous studies. Our shortening estimate relies on accurate thicknesses of lithostratigraphic units, in most cases thinner than applied before. The average convergence rate between \textasciitilde{} 35.3 and \textasciitilde{} 11.0 Ma is estimated at 20.8 km/My. The forward model, constrained by lower and upper ages of syn-orogenic deposits, traces the advance of the Outer Carpathian accretionary wedge and proves kinematic admissibility of the balanced and restored cross-sections. Progradation rates of the foreland basin depositional sequences, evolving from 9–11 km/My between \textasciitilde{} 41.5 and \textasciitilde{} 21.1 Ma to 22–39 km/My between \textasciitilde{} 21.1 and \textasciitilde{} 11.0 Ma, suggest a twophase dynamics of the orogenic system. The acceleration of foreland migration at \textasciitilde{} 21.1 Ma likely reflects the onset of northward subduction retreat, linked to the rollback of the European lower plate that gave rise to coeval back-arc extension in the Pannonian Basin.},

  abstract = {Fluvial morphology is affected by a wide range of forcing factors, which can be external, such as faulting and changes in climate, or internal, such as variations in rock hardness or degree of fracturing. It is a challenge to separate internal and external forcing factors when they are co-located or occur coevally. Failure to account for both factors leads to potential misinterpretations. For example, steepening of channel network due to lithologic contrasts could be misinterpreted to be a function of increased tectonic displacements. These misinterpretations are enhanced over large areas, where landscape properties needed to calculate channel steepness (e.g., channel concavity) can vary significantly in space. In this study, we investigate relative channel steepness over the Eastern Carpathians, where it has been proposed that active rock uplift in the Southeastern Carpathians (SEC) gives way N- and NW-wards to ca. 8 Myrs of post-orogenic quiescence. We develop a technique to quantify relative channel steepness, the relative steepness index, based on a wide range of concavities, and show that the main signal shows an increase in relative steepness index from east to west across the range. Rock hardness measurements and geological studies suggest this difference is driven by lithology. When we isolate channel steepness by lithology to test for ongoing rock uplift along the range, we find steeper channels in the south of the study area compared to the same units in the North. This supports interpretations from longer timescale geological data that active rock uplift is fastest in the southern SEC.},

The resulting trends in a particle-size index reflect the character of sediment delivery into channel segments and the recent channel-forming processes. The largest boulders were observed in channel sections with a strong interaction of slope and fluvial processes, and a slight coarsening of sediments was recorded in the incised downstream sections of the longitudinal stream profile. In contrast, the refining of bed sediments was typical of the transitional zone between slope-channel coupled reaches and an alluvial cone characterised by a tendency to material aggradation.},

  abstract = {Three stream channels that were devoid of evidence of past debris flows and one headwater channel that contained debris flow deposits in the flysch western Carpathians, Czech Republic were selected to test relationships between in-channel processes, bed sediments, and unit stream power calculated for bankfull and Q 20 flows. Contemporary depositional or erosional trends in the examined headwaters were linked with bed sediments that were represented by the coarsest cobble and boulder fraction with a mean calculated from the five largest particles. The downstream trends of the unit stream power were derived for a bankfull discharge and a welldocumented 20-year flood event. In addition, the flow competences during the discharges were calculated using indirect bedload transport measurements. Downstream fining of the cobble and boulder fraction was observed in all of the studied headwaters, and unique downstream variations of the unit stream power were calculated for the longitudinal profiles. The single-thread streams that were devoid of evidence of debris flow events exhibited direct relations between the coarsest sediment size and the unit stream power, especially as calculated for the 20-year flood event and for erosional/depositional trends of the channel. The downstream coarsening of the bed material that was accompanied by an increase in the unit stream power was usually observed in the case of deeply incised (N0.5 m above the assumed bankfull depth) channel reaches. The calculated competence of the 20-year flow was up to twofold higher than that required to entrain the largest bed particle diameters in those channel reaches, and even the bankfull flow was potentially capable of transporting the coarsest bed particles in certain of the reaches. On the other hand, some depositional channel reaches evidently led to the disconnectivity of transport of the coarsest bed material even in the case of the 20-year flood event. The longitudinal profile of the channel that had evidence of past debris flows did not clearly show a direct relationship between boulder size and calculated unit stream power and contemporary channel trends. This finding reflected the presence of significantly coarser bed material, which points to a higher stability of the debris flow-influenced channel during ordinary floods when compared to fluvially dominated headwaters that are devoid of debris flows.},

Connectivity of the largest boulder and cobble fractions has been evaluated in steep streams found in the transitional zones between the hillslopes and alluvial cones of similar lithology and watershed morphometry. Two longitudinal profiles affected by past debris-flow activity and two longitudinal profiles void of such processes were selected. In the first case, active channels were characterised by the presence of the coarsest fraction, while a downstream trend of sediment coarsening or fining lacked any influence of contemporary fluvial processes and sediment supply. In addition, debris-flowaffected streams showed greater differences between the middle axis of the coarsest particle and the particle-size index including the lengths of all three axes, which is most likely the result of limited active fluvial transport. All the studied streams demonstrated general downstream fining of the largest particles, which resulted from local flysch lithology containing more resistant sandstones in the upper parts of the watershed. The trend of sediment fining was more rapid in the longitudinal profiles unaffected by past debris flows. These types of streams also showed adjustment of the coarsest bed fraction to contemporary processes in channels by sediment coarsening in incised reaches and sediment fining in depositional reaches as well as by downstream response to some lateral sediment inputs. The index of the unit stream power showed no correlation with the considered coarsest fraction in both fluvial-dominated channels and debris-flow-affected channels.},

  abstract = {When many people work in organized institutions or enterprises, those institutions or enterprises become big meeting places that also have energy, water and resources necessities. One of these necessities is the correct management of the waste that is daily produced by these communities. Universities are a good example of institution where every day a great amount of people go to work or to study. But independently of their task, they use the different services at the University such as cafeterias, canteens, and photocopy and as a result of their activity a cleaning service is also needed. All these activities generate an environmental impact. Nowadays, many Universities have accepted the challenge to minimize this impact applying several measures. One of the impacts to be reduced is the waste generation. The first step to implement measures to implement a waste management plan at a University is to know the composition, the amount and the distribution of the waste generated in its facilities. As the waste composition and generation depend among other things on the climate, these variables should be analysed over one year. This research work estimates the waste generation and composition of a Spanish University, the Universitat Jaume I, during a school year. To achieve this challenge, all the waste streams generated at the University have been identified and quantified emphasizing on those which are not controlled. Furthermore, several statistical analyses have been carried out to know if the season of the year or the day of the week affect waste generation and composition. All this information will allow the University authorities to propose a set of minimization measures to enhance the current management. Ó 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The recent San Eduardo Landslide (SEL), reactivated on the nighttime of September 20, 2018, is hypothesized as the lowest part of a large-scale deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) covering an area not less than 45~km2. Based upon remote sensing analysis through aerial photography, accompanied by fieldwork, this work attempts to identify the morphostructural features developed after reactivation of the SEL, as well as relict features upslope indicating active sagging of the adjacent mountain slopes. A preliminary segmentation of the SEL into three zones (SEL-1 to SEL-3) is proposed in order to describe the spatial distribution of extensional (e.g., uphill-facing scarps, trenches), compressional (toe bulging), and shear zones within the slid mass. To complement the geomorphological approach, displacement vectors and motion rates were derived by comparing a 5-month time series of free-cloud Sentinel 2 imagery acquired from September 2018 to February 2019. This approach helps to identify a peak motion rate of {$>$}\,4~m/day in zones SEL-2 (between September 18 and 28, 2018) and SEL-3 (between September 8, 2018, and October 8, 2018). By February 2019, the motion rate decreased to less than 30~cm/day. The potential mechanisms explaining the triggering/reactivation of the large slope deformation observed are the cumulative displacement on a shale-dominated slope, and the high topographic stresses expected for this high-relief area in the Colombian Eastern Cordillera. Finally, this work explores the geomorphological evidence of a second DSGSD (sackung type) in the area, which in turn suggests that gravitational deformation is probably a more common deformation mechanism in the range than previously considered.},

  abstract = {Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a warming climate.},

We selected five large landslide events that occurred in the glaciomarine clay in eastern Canada, and calculated cumulative antecedent precipitation for intervals ranging between one and 365 days preceding each event. We also calculated the antecedent precipitation values for every other day in the record, and computed the relative rank of the landslide day within the complete record. Our results show that several intervals for each landslide event are highly ranked – including those preceding a presumably earthquake-triggered landslide – but overall the rankings were highly variable, ranging between 99 \% and 6 \%. The set of highest-ranking intervals are unique for each event, including both short and long-term cumulative precipitation. All of the landslides occurred in the spring months, and the release of sequestered surface and ground water during the spring ground thaw may be related to the timing of the large landslides, so that the evolution of ground frost in the early winter may be of interest for landslide prediction. We found no simple precipitation threshold for triggering large landslides in sensitive glaciomarine clay in eastern Canada, suggesting that some complex temporal and spatial combination of pre-conditions, external energy (e.g. earthquakes), precipitation triggers and other factors such as ground frost formation and thaw are required to trigger a landslide.},

  abstract = {This study identifies and analyzes a group of interrelated morphometric variables that contribute to the morphology of first-order basins in the Siwaliks and the adjacent part of the Lesser Himalaya in the Far West Nepal. First-order basins were identified and their various morphometric indices (21 variables) such as shape, area, pattern, roughness, height, gradient, angle, and distance were obtained from topographic maps (scale 1:25,000) and a digital elevation model using a geographic information system. The study also identifies the basin types based on morphometric properties and assesses their association with lithology, structure, and uplift rates. A principal component analysis identified seven major components that accounted for 78\% of the total variance explained by the original 21 morphometric variables. Variables' loading reveals that the components are the expressions of slope, size, valley/depression, basin shape, relative massiveness, the convergence index, and basin asymmetry. Of these, slope and size components explain 48\% of the total variance. The sets of variables represented by each major component for the entire study area were mostly common to all lithostratigraphic units. Some variables such as drainage density, junction angle, and the sediment transport index have associations with more than one group. This implies that complex geomorphic processes are involved in the development of basin morphology. Using the seven major components, five basin types were recognized by cluster analysis. The distributions of these basin types are similar in the Lower and Middle Siwaliks which have similar geological structures. The geometric relationship between the dip and the topography of a homoclinal structure significantly affects the proportion of basin types, as evidenced by the contrasting proportions between the cuesta and hogback and among dip, anti-dip and orthoclinal slopes. Correlation analysis also confirmed the effect of structure (dipping) on the morphometric variables, and indicated the influence of uplift rates on basin slope, stream slope, elevation range, mean elevation, valley angle, the shape index and the convergence index associated with the active thrust.},

  abstract = {Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) are fairly common phenomena in the Eastern Italian Alps. The Celentino DSGSDs (Trentino–Alto Adige Region, Peio Valley) extends over an area of approximately 5 km2 between 2400 and 1050 m a.s.l. (metres above sea level), involving metamorphic rocks. A set of parallel ridge-top trenches and antislope scarps are present in the upper part of the slope over a length of 2 km. The shear surface is inferred at 80–100 m in depth, and the involved volume is estimated to be 3.5 Â 108 –4.0 Â 108 m3. The displacement of the rock mass has diverted the Noce River for 200 –250 m. Structural, geomorphological and engineering geology surveys were conducted both within and outside the DSGSDs. The evolution of the whole ridge has been modelled using the two-dimensional (2D) finite element code Phase2, simulating the unloading of the glacier cover and assuming a progressive damage of the rock mass. The numerical analyses demonstrate that continuum modelling can be used to examine the evolution of stresses, strains and plastic yielding, providing results consistent with field observations. Structural control due to brittle geological structures seems to be extremely important in the location, shape and extent of the DSGSDs, and post-glacial debuttressing an important predisposing factor in its development and triggering.},

  abstract = {The importance of earthquakes in triggering catastrophic failure of deep-seated landslides has long been recognized and is well documented in the literature. However, seismic waves do not only act as a trigger mechanism. They also contribute to the progressive failure of large rock slopes as a fatigue process that is highly efficient in deforming and damaging rock slopes. Given the typically long recurrence time and unpredictability of earthquakes, field-based investigations of co-seismic rock slope deformations are difficult. We present here a conceptual numerical study that demonstrates how repeated earthquake activity over time can destabilize a relatively strong rock slope by creating and propagating new fractures until the rock mass is sufficiently weakened to initiate catastrophic failure. Our results further show that the damage and displacement induced by a certain earthquake strongly depends on pre-existing damage. In fact, the damage history of the slope influences the earthquake-induced displacement as much as earthquake ground motion characteristics such as the peak ground acceleration. Because seismically induced fatigue is: (1) characterized by low repeat frequency, (2) represents a large amplitude damage event, and (3) weakens the entire rock mass, it differs from other fatigue processes. Hydro-mechanical cycles, for instance, occur at higher repeat frequencies (i.e., annual cycles), lower amplitude, and only affect limited parts of the rock mass. Thus, we also compare seismically induced fatigue to seasonal hydro-mechanical fatigue.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a detailed analysis of a dramatic rock slope acceleration that occurred in fall 2016 at the Moosfluh Landslide, located at the glacier tongue of the Great Aletsch Glacier (Switzerland). The acceleration that occurred in 2016 was unanticipated and exposed the valley bottom and an adjacent damned lake to high risk. This acceleration occurred in an active deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) controlled primarily by deep block-flexural toppling. In 2013, a highly accurate displacement monitoring system was developed and installed in the surroundings of the Great Aletsch Glacier, including a time-lapse camera, GNSS, and robotic total stations. This monitoring system provided unique data during the 2016 slope acceleration which are used in this study to assess failure mechanisms, landslide volumes, and subsurface displacement geometry. Based on a novel displacement vector analysis, we find that three retrogressive secondary rockslides developed during the first six weeks of the slope acceleration, with rupture surface depths of 30 to 40 m, and estimated volumes between 1 and 4 Mm3. These rockslides display complex deformation features, including head and lateral scarps, which developed during the slope acceleration. The kinematics of these secondary rockslides changed through time, from primarily toppling to combined toppling and sliding. Our results provide a uniquely detailed understanding of the spatial and temporal evolution of deformation features and movement kinematics that occur when several sectors of a slowly moving DSGSD transitions into rapid rockslides.},

Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), seismic refraction tomography (SRT) and spectral analysis of surface waves (SWM) have been adopted to determine the overburden thickness and the geometry of the sliding surfaces. The geomechanical characterisation of rock mass was performed by means of horizontal seismic profiles (HSP) and sonic log in a horizontal borehole. The results have been calibrated by comparing the geophysical responses with the geological evidence derived from boreholes and with the movements recorded using inclinometric probe. Moreover, borehole geophysics results were validated by the results of laboratory measurements performed on core samples. The integration of geophysical and geotechnical results allowed the definition of a subsoil model for the investigated area and provided the necessary data for the design of the roadway tunnel. The study shows that surface and borehole geophysical techniques could be an efficient and cost-effective tool in rockslide investigations.},

Relative to crustal faulting studies, quantitative seismic, geodetic, and creep meas- urements of landslide deformation may be made in a very short time with readily available instrumentation and at relatively minimal expense. Our results indicate that the displace- ment of landslide material occurs along discrete faults exhibiting a combination of brittle failure, indicated by slide quakes and creep events, and as stable sliding observed as steady-state creep. Although slide quakes were observed, a more steady-state failure pro- cess of relieving accumulating strain is indicated.},

  abstract = {Relict surfaces contain information on past surface processes and long-term landscape evolution. A detailed investigation of relict non-glacial surfaces in a formerly glaciated mountain landscape of northern Sweden was completed, based on interpretation of colour infrared aerial photographs, analysis in a GIS, and fieldwork. Working backwards from landscape to process, surfaces were classified according to large- and small-scale morphologies that result from the operation of non-glacial processes, the degree of weathering, regolith characteristics, and the style of glacial modification. Surfaces were also compared in the GIS according to elevation, slope angle, and bedrock lithology. The study revealed five types of relict non-glacial surfaces but also two types of extensively weathered glacial surfaces that were transitional to relict non-glacial surfaces, illustrating spatially variable processes and rates of non-glacial and glacial landscape evolution. Rather than being static preglacial remnants, relict non-glacial surfaces are dynamic features that have continued to evolve during the Quaternary. The classification provides hypotheses for landscape evolution that can be field tested through, for example, terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide studies and geochemical analyses of fine matrix materials. The classification may be applicable to relict non-glacial surfaces in other formerly glaciated landscapes.},

The RO membranes were taken from a seawater desalination plant after 4years of operation. Chemical and structural characterization was performed using different analytical methods, including visual observation, optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and ion chromatography (IC). The fouling layer consisted of particulate matter embedded in an apparently amorphous matrix, which was unevenly distributed over the membrane surface with the greatest accumulation in the valley areas. Inorganic and organic foulants were identified in the RO membranes. Inorganic foulants mainly consisted of hydrogen aluminosilicates and halite. The main organics substances identified were proteins, polysaccharides and humic compounds and were attributed to biofouling. Chemical analysis revealed that Si, Al, Cl, Ca, Na, Mg and K were the predominant elements contributing to membrane fouling. The reasons for the deposition of foulants on the RO membranes are the increase of membrane selectivity due to biofouling, the large size of cartridge filters and the high operating pressure.},

  abstract = {Active faulting is one of the main factors that induce deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DGSDs). In this study, we investigate the relationships between the tectonic activity of the NW–SE normal fault system along Mt. Morrone, central Apennines, Italy, and the evolution of the associated sackung-type DGSD. The fault system is considered to be the source of M 6.5–7 earthquakes. Our investigations have revealed that the DGSD began to affect the Mt. Morrone SW slope after the Early Pleistocene. This was due to the progressive slope instability arising from the onset of the younger western fault, with the older eastern fault acting as the preferred sliding zone. Paleoseismological investigations based on the excavation of slope deposits across gravitational troughs revealed that the DGSD was also responsible for the displacement of Late Pleistocene–Holocene sediments accumulated in the sackung troughs. Moreover, we observed that the investigated DGSD can evolve into large-scale rock slides. Therefore, as well as active normal faulting, the DGSD should be considered as the source of a further geological hazard. Overall, our approach can be successfully applied to other contexts where active normal faults control the inception and evolution of a DGSD.},

The method is based on assigning digital terrain attributes into continuous landform classes. The continuous landform classification is achieved by applying a fuzzy k-means approach to a watershed scale area before the classification is extrapolated to a broader region. The extrapolated fuzzy landform classes and datasets of road-related and non road-related landslides are then combined in a geographic information system (GIS) for the exploration of predictive correlations and model development. In particular, a Bayesian probabilistic modeling approach is illustrated using a case study of the Clearwater National Forest (CNF) in central Idaho, which experienced significant and widespread landslide events in recent years. The computed landslide hazard potential is presented on probabilistic maps for roaded and roadless areas. The maps can be used as a decision support tool in forest planning involving the maintenance, obliteration or development of new forest roads in steep mountainous terrain.},

The landslide, resulting in the collapse of a 5 km segment of Mount Akdag, covers an area of 9.8 km2 and has a volume of about 3 × 108 m3. The 1:15,000 scale geomorphological map (Main Map) of the Akdag landslide presented here was produced from a combination of field studies and unmanned aerial vehicle-based DSM, including aerial-photo interpretation and geomorphometric analysis of landforms. The map shows contemporary and past geomorphological hillslope processes and landforms associated with the landslide complex. Our new map suggests that the Akdag landslide was a complex rockslide consisting of multiple landslide types that developed through various movements. We found that 43 highly developed and active mass movements on the main body and side slopes of the landslide made a major contribution to the sediment input. The sediment produced in the upstream severely threatens the touristic site of Saklikent Canyon in the lower catchment via an increasing magnitude of torrents. This map will provide important data for local and national administrators regarding monitoring up-to-date mass-wasting processes, understanding the landslide and its related sedimentary dynamics, and implementing risk assessment and necessary precautions.},

In high latitudes the soil distribution is strongly controlled by geogenic factors (relief and substrates). Locally they transform the Arctic macroclimate, which is principally humid, to produce arid phenomena in the soil landscapes. All the soil processes from podzolization to salinization can be qualitatively distinguished in every region of the Arctic. Quantitatively, the eect of these soil-forming processes decreases with increasing latitude. A new zonal division of Arctic soils is proposed, comprising (1) High Arctic barren (tundra), (2) Mid Arctic tundra and (3) Low Arctic and Subarctic tundra. In addition to climate warming, important consequences of global change are soil pollution and the physical disturbance of the Arctic soil cover. All the countries of the northern hemisphere are contributing to Arctic soil pollution. Winter warming associated with climate change could cause an intensi®cation of cryoturbation in the continental part of Siberia and lead to the more active fossilization of soil carbon and the increased importance of the cryopedosphere as a carbon sink.

  abstract = {The cosmogenic nuclide exposure history method is undergoing major developments in analytical, theoretical, and applied areas. The capability to routinely measure low concentrations of stable and radioactive cosmogenic nuclides has led to new methods for addressing long-standing geologic questions and has provided insights into rates and styles of sur"cial processes. The di!erent physical and chemical properties of the six most widely used nuclides:  He,   Be,   C,   Ne,   Al, and   Cl, make it possible to apply the surface exposure dating methods on rock surfaces of virtually any lithology at any latitude and altitude, for exposures ranging from 10  to 10  years. The terrestrial in situ cosmogenic nuclide method is beginning to revolutionize the manner in which we study landscape evolution. Single or multiple nuclides can be measured in a single rock surface to obtain erosion rates on boulder and bedrock surfaces, \#uvial incision rates, denudation rates of individual landforms or entire drainage basins, burial histories of rock surfaces and sediment, scarp retreat, fault slip rates, paleoseismology, and paleoaltimetry. Ages of climatic variations recorded by moraine and alluvium sediments are being directly determined. Advances in our understanding of how cosmic radiation interacts with the geomagnetic "eld and atmosphere will improve numerical simulations of cosmic-ray interactions over any exposure duration and complement additional empirical measurements of nuclide production rates. The total uncertainty in the exposure ages is continually improving. This article presents the theory necessary for interpreting cosmogenic nuclide data, reviews estimates of parameters, describes strategies and practical considerations in "eld applications, and assesses sources of error in interpreting cosmogenic nuclide measurements. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

One example is the missing ice problem during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26\,000-19\,000 years before present) – an apparent 8-28 m discrepancy between far-field sea level indicators and modelled sea level from ice sheet reconstructions. In the absence of ice sheet reconstructions, researchers often use marine δ18O proxy records to infer ice volume prior to the LGM. We present a global ice sheet reconstruction for the past 80\,000 years, called PaleoMIST 1.0, constructed independently of far-field sea level and δ18O proxy records. Our reconstruction is compatible with LGM far-field sea-level records without requiring extra ice volume, thus solving the missing ice problem. However, for Marine Isotope Stage 3 (57\,000-29\,000 years before present) - a pre-LGM period - our reconstruction does not match proxy-based sea level reconstructions, indicating the relationship between marine δ18O and sea level may be more complex than assumed.},

  abstract = {Cycles of glaciation impose mechanical stresses on underlying bedrock as glaciers advance, erode, and retreat. Fracture initiation and propagation constitute rock mass damage and act as preparatory factors for slope failures; however, the mechanics of paraglacial rock slope damage remain poorly characterized. Using conceptual numerical models closely based on the Aletsch Glacier region of Switzerland, we explore how in situ stress changes associated with fluctuating ice thickness can drive progressive rock mass failure preparing future slope instabilities. Our simulations reveal that glacial cycles as purely mechanical loading and unloading phenomena produce relatively limited new damage. However, ice fluctuations can increase the criticality of fractures in adjacent slopes, which may in turn increase the efficacy of fatigue processes. Bedrock erosion during glaciation promotes significant new damage during first deglaciation. An already weakened rock slope is more susceptible to damage from glacier loading and unloading and may fail completely. We find that damage kinematics are controlled by discontinuity geometry and the relative position of the glacier; ice advance and retreat both generate damage. We correlate model results with mapped landslides around the Great Aletsch Glacier. Our result that most damage occurs during first deglaciation agrees with the relative age of the majority of identified landslides. The kinematics and dimensions of a slope failure produced in our models are also in good agreement with characteristics of instabilities observed in the field. Our results extend simplified assumptions of glacial debuttressing, demonstrating in detail how cycles of ice loading, erosion, and unloading drive paraglacial rock slope damage.},

  abstract = {Subglacial water pressures influence groundwater conditions in proximal alpine valley rock slopes, varying with glacier advance and retreat in parallel with changing ice thickness. Fluctuating groundwater pressures in turn increase or reduce effective joint normal stresses, affecting the yield strength of discontinuities. Here we extend simplified assumptions of glacial debuttressing to investigate how glacier loading cycles together with changing groundwater pressures generate rock slope damage and prepare future slope instabilities. Using hydromechanical coupled numerical models closely based on the Aletsch Glacier valley in Switzerland, we simulate Late Pleistocene and Holocene glacier loading cycles including long-term and annual groundwater fluctuations. Measurements of transient subglacial water pressures from ice boreholes in the Aletsch Glacier ablation area, as well as continuous monitoring of bedrock deformation from permanent Global Navigation Satellite Systems stations, help verify our model assumptions. While purely mechanical glacier loading cycles create only limited rock slope damage in our models, introducing a fluctuating groundwater table generates substantial new fracturing. Superposed annual groundwater cycles increase predicted damage. The cumulative effects are capable of destabilizing the eastern valley flank of our model in toppling-mode failure, similar to field observations of active landslide geometry and kinematics. We find that hydromechanical fatigue is most effective acting in combination with long-term loading and unloading of the slope during glacial cycles. Our results demonstrate that hydromechanical stresses associated with glacial cycles are capable of generating substantial rock slope damage and represent a key preparatory factor for paraglacial slope instabilities.},

  abstract = {Cycles of glaciation alter the temperature field in proximal alpine valley flanks, driving rock slope damage through thermomechanical stresses. Here we extend simplified assumptions of glacial debuttressing to quantitatively examine how paraglacial bedrock temperature changes, acting in concert with changing ice loads during Late Pleistocene and Holocene glacial cycles, create damage in adjacent rock slopes and prepare future slope instabilities. When in contact with temperate glacier ice, valley walls maintain near isothermal 0 °C surface temperatures and are shielded from daily and annual cycles. With retreat, rock walls are rapidly exposed to strongly varying temperature boundary conditions, a transition we term “paraglacial thermal shock.” Using detailed, conceptual numerical models based on the Aletsch Glacier in Switzerland, we show that including thermomechanical stresses during simulated glacial cycles creates significantly more rock slope damage than predicted for purely mechanical ice loading and unloading. Glacier advances are especially effective in generating damage as rapid cooling drives contraction of the rock mass reducing joint normal stresses. First time exposure to annual temperature cycles during deglaciation induces a shallow damage front that follows the retreating ice margin, generating damage in a complementary process at shorter time scales. Acting on a reduced strength rock mass, modeled thermomechanical cycles enhance the development of a slope instability with similar attributes as observed in our study area. Our results demonstrate that thermomechanical stresses acting in conjunction with changing ice loads are capable of generating considerable rock slope damage with spatial and temporal patterns controlled by glacier extents.},

  abstract = {Large rock avalanches constitute a critical process modulating the evolution of alpine landscapes; however, the relatively infrequent occurrence of these high-magnitude events makes identifying underlying process controls challenging. Here we describe two rock avalanches in the Rinderhorn area of the Bernese Alps, Switzerland, providing new mapping of rock avalanche source areas and deposits, refined volume estimates for each event, runout modeling back-analyses, and absolute age constraint from cosmogenic 36Cl surface exposure dating. Results reveal that the Daubensee rock avalanche released \textasciitilde 4 million m3 of limestone sliding from the western crest of the Rinderhorn. Debris ran out across a Lateglacial moraine before reaching the valley bottom and spreading, leaving thin (on average 7 m) deposits across a broad area. The runout resulted in a Fahrböschung angle of 21°. Part of the deposit now lies beneath Lake Daubensee. The Klein Rinderhorn rock avalanche released \textasciitilde{} 37 million m3 of limestone along a dip-slope sliding plane, with a maximum runout distance of 4.3 km and estimated Fahrböschung angle of 14°. Deposits bulked to \textasciitilde{} 47 million m3 running up the opposing slope, with distinct hummocky morphology in the proximal area and a distal longitudinal flow ridge. These deposits were later modified and partly obscured by ice avalanches from the nearby Altels peak. Cosmogenic 36Cl surface exposure dating revealed nearly coincident ages for both rock avalanches of 9.8 ± 0.5 ka. The large lag time between local deglaciation and failure suggests that the events were not directly triggered by deglaciation. Rather, the concurrent exposure ages, also coinciding with the nearby Kander valley rock avalanche as well as paleoseismic records from nearby lakes, strongly suggest seismic triggering.},

  abstract = {Litho-structural control on the spatial and temporal evolution of landslides is one of the major typical aspects on slopes constituted of structurally complex sequences. Mainly focused on instabilities of the earth flow type, a semi-quantitative analysis has been developed with the purpose of identifying and characterizing litho-structural control exerted by bedding on slopes and its effects on landsliding. In quantitative terms, a technique for azimuth data interpolation, Non-continuous Azimuth Distribution Methodological Approach (NADIA), is presented by means of a GIS software application. In addition, processed by NADIA, two indexes have been determined: (i) , aimed at defining the relationship between the orientation of geological bedding planes and slope aspect, and (ii) C, which recognizes localized slope sectors in which the stony component of structurally complex formations is abundant and therefore operates an evolutive control of landslide masses. Furthermore, some Litho-Structural Models (LSMs) of slopes are proposed aiming at characterizing recurrent forms of structural control in the source, channel and deposition areas of gravitational movements. In order to elaborate evolutive models controlling landslide scenarios, LSMs were qualitatively related and compared with and C quantitative indexes. The methodological procedure has been applied to a lithostructurally complex area of Southern Italy where data about azimuth measurements and landslide mapping were known. It was found that the proposed methodology enables the recognition of typical control conditions on landslides in relation to the LSMs. Different control patterns on landslide shape and on style and distribution of the activity resulted for each LSM. This provides the possibility for first-order identification to be made of the spatial evolution of landslide bodies.},

The Vakhsh River catchment (Tajikistan) is situated along a thrust system in the collision zone between the Northern Pamir and the Western Tian Shan. In this study, spatial variations in catchment-wide denudation rates are reported from the Vakhsh River catchment with in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al of 22 samples from active river channels. Samples distributed along 140\,km of the main Vakhsh River yield denudation rates between 1.28\,±\,0.16 to 1.94\,±\,0.26\,mm/yr. In detail, samples from rivers draining the Northern Pamir indicate denudation rates of \textasciitilde 1.7\,mm/yr, and a river draining the Alai Valley indicates denudation rates of 1.14\,±\,0.14\,mm/yr. In contrast, rivers draining the Western Tian Shan show increasing denudation rates from 0.18\,±\,0.02\,mm/yr in the west to 2.70\,±\,0.36\,mm/yr in the east, coincident with a small increase in the fluvial normalized steepness index (ksn). Measured 26Al/10Be ratios range from 5.2 to 7.6, indicating a low influence of sediment storage and reworking of partially shielded material. In addition, locations resampled one year later confirm previously calculated denudation rates along the main trunk. Analysis of in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be from depth profiles collected from a sequence of terraces preserved along the main trunk of the Vakhsh River indicate terrace incision starting at \textasciitilde 3\,kyr as well as paleo-denudation rates ranging between 1.75\,±\,0.54 to 2.01\,±\,0.39\,mm/yr (2\,s.d. errors). All these results suggest consistent high denudation rates in the Northern Pamir block, and a spatial (along strike) gradient in Western Tian Shan denudation rates. The most likely explanation for the spatial gradient in Western Tian Shan and Vakhsh River denudation rates is a regional gradient in tectonic rock uplift.},

No single definition exists; however, within the context of geomorphometry, we use surface roughness as an expression of the variability of a topographic surface at a given scale, where the scale of analysis is determined by the size of the landforms or geomorphic features of interest. Six techniques for the calculation of surface roughness were selected for an assessment of the parameter’s behavior at different spatial scales and data-set resolutions. Area ratio operated independently of scale, providing consistent results across spatial resolutions. Vector dispersion produced results with increasing roughness and homogenization of terrain at coarser resolutions and larger window sizes. Standard deviation of residual topography highlighted local features and did not detect regional relief. Standard deviation of elevation correctly identified breaks of slope and was good at detecting regional relief. Standard deviation of slope (SDslope) also correctly identified smooth sloping areas and breaks of slope, providing the best results for geomorphological analysis. Standard deviation of profile curvature identified the breaks of slope, although not as strongly as SDslope, and it is sensitive to noise and spurious data. In general, SDslope offered good performance at a variety of scales, while the simplicity of calculation is perhaps its single greatest benefit.},

  abstract = {The reasonable design of protective structures to mitigate the hazards from rock fall depends on the knowledge of motion behaviors of falling stones，such as the falling paths，velocities，jump heights and distances. Numerical simulation is an effective way to gain such kind of knowledge. In this paper，the discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) is applied to rock fall analysis. In order to obtain more reliable results，the following improvements and extensions are made on the original DDA. (1) Solve the problem of block expansions due to rigid body rotation error. (2) Add the function of modeling the drag resistance from air and plants so that the velocities of falling stones obtained by simulations are good enough in agreement with those by experiments in situ. (3) Add the capability to consider energy loss due to block collisions so that the jumping heights and distances obtained by simulations are good enough in agreement with those by experiments even for the slope with very soft layer on its surface. One of application examples is presented to show that the extended DDA is very effective and useful in rock fall analysis. Therefore，the presented method is expected to be put into wide use in slop stability analysis.},

We compared a mountain-slope failure model neglecting the effect of rock strength loss with a model simulating the effect of strength loss and integrating cohesional weakening and frictional strengthening processes. The good correspondence between the relative chronology and location of observed and simulated deformations shows that (1) the gradual loss of rock mass strength related to stress release effects following the Pleistocene deglaciation can be as long as several thousands of years, and (2) the causes and triggering of the present-day active landslides are related to this long failure history. Our study suggests that the episodic nature of massive rock slides can be explained through the gradual development of tensile and shear failure, and time-dependent strength degradation. Our numerical model is a good reproduction of large landslides at the regional-scale of a mountainous massif.},

Based on spatially distributed directional information on planar geological fabrics and DEMderived topographic attribute data, the internal geometry of rock slopes can be characterized on a grid cell basis. For such computations, different approaches for the analysis and regionalization of available structural directional information applicable in specific tectonic settings are demonstrated and implemented in a GIS environment. Simple kinematical testing procedures based on feasibility criteria can be conducted on a pixel basis to determine which failure mechanisms are likely to occur at particular terrain locations. In combination with hydraulic and strength data on geological discontinuities, scenario-based rock slope stability evaluations can be performed. For conceptual investigations on rock slope failure processes, a GIS-based specification tool for a 2-D distinct element code (UDEC) was designed to operate with the GIS-encoded spatially distributed rock slope data. The concepts of the proposed methodology for rock slope hazard assessments are demonstrated at three different test sites in Germany.},

  abstract = {Landslide magnitude–frequency curves allow for the probabilistic characterization of regional landslide hazard. There is evidence that landslides exhibit self-organized criticality including the tendency to follow a power law over part of the magnitude–frequency distribution. Landslide distributions, however, also typically exhibit poor agreement with the power law at smaller sizes in a flattening of the slope known as rollover. Understanding the basis for this difference is critical if we are to accurately predict landslide hazard, risk or landscape denudation over large areas. One possible argument is that the magnitude–frequency distribution is dominated by physiographic controls whereby landslides tend to a larger size, and larger landslides are landscape limited according to a power law. We explore the physiographic argument using first a simple deterministic model and then a cellular automata model for watersheds in coastal British Columbia. The results compare favorably to actual landslide data: modeled landslides bifurcate at local elevation highs, deposit mass preferentially where the local slopes decrease, find routes in confined valley or channel networks, and, when sufficiently large, overwhelm the local topography. The magnitude–frequency distribution of both the actual landslides and the cellular automata model follow a power law for magnitudes higher than 10,000–20,000 m2 and show a flattening of the slope for smaller magnitudes. Based on the results of both models, we argue that magnitude–frequency distributions, including both the rollover and the power law components, are a result of actual physiographic limitations related to slope, slope distance, and the distribution of mass within landslides. The cellular automata model uses simple empirically based rules that can be gathered for regions worldwide.},

  abstract = {One hundred and one landslides were documented across 370 km2 following a rainstorm that swept the British Columbia coastline on 18 November 2001. Despite the regional nature of the storm, the landslides were spaced close together, even within the study area. Landslide clustering is attributed to high intensity storm cells too small to be recorded by the general hydrometric network. The evidence nicely corroborates previous historical studies that reached similar conclusions, but against which there was no modern analog analyzed for coastal British Columbia. Magnitudecumulative frequency data plotted well on a power law curve for landslides greater than 10 000 m2, however, below that size several curves would fit. The rollover effect, a point where the data is no longer represented by the power law, therefore occurs at about 1.5 orders of magnitude higher than the smallest landslide. Additional work on Vancouver Island has provided evidence for rollovers at similar values. We propose that the rollover is a manifestation of the physical conditions of landslide occurrence and process uniformity. The data was fit to a double Pareto distribution and P-P plots were generated for several data sets to examine the fit of that model. The double Pareto model describes the bulk of the data well, however, less well at the tails. For small landslides ({$<$}650 m2) this may still be a product of censoring. Landscape denudation from the storm was averaged over the study area and equal to 2 mm of erosion. This is more than an order of magnitude larger than the annual rate of denudation reported by other authors for coastal British Columbia, but substantially less than New Zealand. The number is somewhat affected by the rather arbitrary choice of a study area boundary.},

A systematic analysis of rapid landsliding (the analysis did not consider creep and other slow semi-continuous processes) indicates that moderate-sized landslides do the most work transporting material on hillslopes. The work peak defines the moderate magnitude, and that magnitude varies based on local physiography and climate. Landslides that form the work peak are distinct from catastrophic landslides that are themselves formative and system resetting. The persistence time for debris slides/ debris flows (PDS) and rock slides/rock avalanches (PRS) is calculated over six orders of magnitude. We consider an event catastrophic when it persists in the landscape, as described by a persistence ratio (PF), an order of magnitude longer than the population of landslides that form the work peak.},

Previous studies of sackung landforms in the Pyrenees have argued for deglacial unloading as the genetic mechanism, but this causal and temporal relationship has not been proved due to the lack of chronological data. The antislope scarps in the two studied locations, Vallibierna and Esto´ s, are developed in Palaeozoic metasedimentary rocks (parallel to the contour lines and the structural grain), occur in the intermediate sector of the hillslope, and are up to 0.5 km long and several meters high. A trench was excavated in a sackung trough fill in each of the valleys in order to gain information about their chronology and genesis. Charcoal from the lowermost unit in Vallibierna provided an age of 5.9 cal. ka for the sackung and extrapolation of the three dates obtained in Esto´ s indicates that the trough formed ca. 7.6–7.8 cal. ka. Deglaciation of the studied sectors of the valleys occurred between 16 and 13 ka. The time lag of N5 ka suggests that glacial erosion and the subsequent debutressing of the oversteepened valley walls created slopes predisposed to sackung development, but did not initiate the movement. Seismic shaking is proposed as a probable triggering factor. This hypothesis, although supported by the sudden deformation event recorded by a failure plane exposed in Vallibierna trench, and by the seismic and neotectonic activity of the area, cannot be proved due to the lack of chronological information about paleoearthquakes.},

  abstract = {The origin and morpho-stratigraphic evolution of the largest playa-lake system (La Playa–El Pueyo) in the Bujaraloz–Sástago endorheic area, located in the semiarid central sector of the Ebro Depression, are analysed. The enclosed depressions are developed on gypsiferous Tertiary bedrock and show a prevalent WNW–ESE orientation parallel to the direction of the prevalent strong local wind (Cierzo). Yardangs have been carved in bedrock and unconsolidated terrace deposits in the leeward sector of the largest lake basins. A sequence of three lacustrine terrace levels has been identified by detailed geomorphological mapping. The treads of the upper, middle and lower terrace levels are situated at + 9 m, + 6 m and + 0.5 m above the playa-lake floors, respectively. Seismic refraction and electrical resistivity profiles acquired in La Playa reveal a thin basin fill (\textasciitilde 2 m) with a planar base. These data allow ruling out the genetic hypothesis for the depressions involving the collapse of large bedrock cavities and support a mixed genesis of combined widespread dissolution and subsidence by groundwater discharge and eolian deflation during dry periods. The 5 m thick deposit of the middle terrace was investigated in hand-dug and backhoe trenches. Six AMS radiocarbon ages from this terrace indicate an aggradation phase between 3.9 ka and ca. 2 ka. These numerical ages yield a maximum average aggradation rate of 2.6 mm/yr and a minimum excavation rate by wind deflation of 3 mm/yr subsequent to the accumulation of the middle terrace. The latter figure compares well with those calculated in several arid regions of the world using yardangs carved in palaeolake deposits. The aggradation phase between 4 and 2 ka is coherent with other Iberian and Mediterranean records showing relatively more humid conditions after 4 ka, including the Iron Ages and the Iberian–Roman Period.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive analysis of the distribution of landslides was completed in the Upper Tiber River basin, central Italy. Landslide occurrence was ascertained through a large-scale inventory obtained through air-photo-interpretation (API) and local field surveys. Lithological and bedding information was obtained through photo-geological and field mapping, aided by the review of geological maps and reports. The probability density of landslide areas was found comparable to statistics obtained by investigators in other areas of the world. Adoption of empirical relationships to link landslide area and volume allowed estimating the total volume of landslide material in the 4098 km2 catchment in excess of 5.9 × 109 m3. Statistics of terrain elevation and slope in stable areas were found different from those in landslide areas. In particular, modal terrain slope in landslide areas was less steep (11.9°) than that in areas where landslides were not mapped (13.3°). Analysis of the landslide and slope areas revealed that a relationship exists between the size of the slope and the size of the most common landslide. Analysis of the spatial relationship between landslides and the geological setting revealed that slope failures are most abundant where soft and weak rocks crop out, and where bedding is chaotic or disorganized. Where rocks are regularly bedded, landslide abundance is largest in dip-slopes. These new findings are important to understand the long-term evolution of the Upper Tiber River basin, and may prove useful in the assessment of landslide hazard and risk.},

  abstract = {Landslides are present in all continents, and play an important role in the evolution of landscapes. They also represent a serious hazard in many areas of the world. Despite their importance, we estimate that landslide maps cover less than 1\% of the slopes in the landmasses, and systematic information on the type, abundance, and distribution of landslides is lacking. Preparing landslide maps is important to document the extent of landslide phenomena in a region, to investigate the distribution, types, pattern, recurrence and statistics of slope failures, to determine landslide susceptibility, hazard, vulnerability and risk, and to study the evolution of landscapes dominated by mass-wasting processes. Conventional methods for the production of landslide maps rely chiefly on the visual interpretation of stereoscopic aerial photography, aided by field surveys. These methods are time consuming and resource intensive. New and emerging techniques based on satellite, airborne, and terrestrial remote sensing technologies, promise to facilitate the production of landslide maps, reducing the time and resources required for their compilation and systematic update. In this work, we first outline the principles for landslide mapping, and we review the conventional methods for the preparation of landslide maps, including geomorphological, event, seasonal, and multi-temporal inventories. Next, we examine recent and new technologies for landslide mapping, considering (i) the exploitation of very-high resolution digital elevation models to analyze surface morphology, (ii) the visual interpretation and semiautomatic analysis of different types of satellite images, including panchromatic, multispectral, and synthetic aperture radar images, and (iii) tools that facilitate landslide field mapping. Next, we discuss the advantages and the limitations of the new remote sensing data and technology for the production of geomorphological, event, seasonal, and multi-temporal inventory maps. We conclude by arguing that the new tools will help to improve the quality of landslide maps, with positive effects on all derivative products and analyses, including erosion studies and landscape modeling, susceptibility and hazard assessments, and risk evaluations.},

Data set A contains 16 809 landslide areas in the Umbria\^Marche area of central Italy; they represent a reconnaissance inventory of very old, old, and recent (modern) landslides. The noncumulative frequency\^area distribution of these landslides correlates well with a power-law relation, exponent 32.5, over the range 0.03 km2 6 AL 6 4 km2. Data set B contains 4233 landslides that were triggered by a sudden change in temperature on 1 January 1997, resulting in extensive melting of snow cover. An inventory of these snow-melt-triggered landslides was obtained from aerial photographs taken 3 months after the event. These landslides also correlate well with a power-law relation with exponent 32.5, over the range 0.001 km2 6 AL 6 0.1 km2. We show that the correlation of data set B is essentially identical to the correlation of 11 000 landslides triggered by the 17 January 1994 Northridge, California earthquake. We attribute a rollover for small landslides in data set A to incompleteness of the record due to erosion and other processes, and to limitations in the reconnaissance mapping technique used to complete the inventory. On the other hand, we conclude that rollovers for small landslides in data set B and the California earthquake data are real and are associated with the surface morphology. We conclude that the power-law distribution is valid over a wide range of landslide areas and discuss possible reasons. We also discuss the contribution of the snow-melt- and earthquake-triggered landslide events to the total landslide inventory. ß 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The \textasciitilde 90-km-long slide mass consists of \textasciitilde 1700–2000 km3 of andesitic volcanic mudflow breccias and subordinate lava flows, sandstones, and intertongued regional ash-flow tuffs. The MGS extends over an area of {$>$}3400 km2 and advanced {$>$}30 km to the south over the Miocene land surface. The low-angle basal slip surface is in Eocene–Oligocene Brian Head Formation, a weak, clay-rich, tuffaceous sedimentary unit at the base of the volcanic section. The presence of a basal zone of cataclastic and sheared breccia with associated clastic dikes, and pseudotachylyte along secondary shear planes, provides strong evidence of catastrophic emplacement. The uniformity of directional indicators, stratigraphy, and overall geometry of the MGS suggests that it represents a singleemplacement event coeval with late-stage magmatic doming of the volcanic field. The MGS thus represents one of the largest subaerial volcanic landslides on Earth, and along with the comparable Heart Mountain gravity slide in northwest Wyoming, constitutes a class of catastrophic collapse hazard not widely recognized within modern volcanic fields.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric warming is predicted to be greater in polar regions than at lower latitudes and more pronounced at high altitudes than in lowlands. In polar regions, air and ground warming may lead to a more northerly exten-sion of the boreal forest, as growing seasons lengthen and become warmer. Near-surface permafrost degradation will probably accompany such an evolution in environmental conditions. In some cases slope movement may be catastrophic, but in most instances the settlement is expected to be slow, and the water released by melting ground ice will evaporate. Subpolar forests in permafrost regions are primarily used for firewood and rough lumber, but not construction-grade materials. This is unlikely to change because long-term ground instability, relatively cold soil temperatures, depletion of nutrients in the active layer, and restriction of root systems to the active layer all limit tree growth. Extensive forest fires, usually initiated by lightning after a week or two of hot weather, also deplete timber stocks. There have been suggestions that wildfire may increase following climate warming. Meltwater runoff from glaciated and perennially frozen areas represents only a small portion of the annual water supply, but strongly influences stream flow in lowlands during the warm/dry season. The disappearance of perennial ice above and below the earth surface influences the seasonality of discharge by reducing meltwater production in the warm season and by increasing the permeability of frozen/thawing materials. The latter effect may have strong impacts on soil humidity and growth conditions for forest and tundra in such dry areas as Tian Shan Mountains or Tibet Plateau. In general, accelerated future warming},

  abstract = {The elastic impulse-from an explosion is propagated through the earth as an expanding shell bounded by the wavefront. This wavefront and its motion are a physical reality while rays or trajectories are much less sharply defined and cannot actually be observed because the wavelengths involved in seismic processes are too long. This means that the visualization and the interpretation of seismic processes can be carried out in a more satisfactory, simple and comprehensible way with wavefronts than with rays. H. R. Thornburgh (1930) introduced the very lucid and simple method of interpreting seismic refraction sections, using Huygen's principle to construct wavefronts from two symmetrical shotpoints by working back from their observed arrival times at the surface. The depths are found first with only a knowledge of the velocities down to the refractor and after that the velocities in the refractor can be determined. The pattern of the two wavefronts at equal time intervals, obtained when carrying out Thornburgh's construction, leads to the very simple, approximative “Plus-Minus” method. The additions of the travel times from two symmetrical shotpoints to-each geophone give the relative depths and their subtractions give the velocities of the refractor. The method extrapolates exact quantities from the refractor boundary up to the surface by the “Plus”- and “Minus” lines. This extrapolation introduces errors that can, more or less, be corrected for. A number of hypothetical cases are presented to give an insight into the applicability and reliability of the “Plus-Minus” method. Its main applications are for fairly shallow refraction investigations and for determining weathering corrections for refraction and reflection work.},

  abstract = {In deep underground excavations in hard rocks where stresses easily exceed the micro-crack initiation stress level inside the rock mass, proper consideration of the behaviour of rockmass during the brittle fracturing process in constitutive modelling is of paramount importance. Current empirical and conventional experimental methods for obtaining the deformational behaviours of hard rocks under loading do not lead to results that can be matched with in situ failure observations. This paper demonstrates that this problem is not necessarily a matter of the general notion of size effect but rather can be related to the different circumstances under which the cohesive and frictional strength components are mobilized in laboratory compression tests and around underground openings. It is also demonstrated that the propagation of the failed or breakout zone (depth and extent) is a function of the strain-dependent brittleness index IBε introduced in this paper, which explicitly considers the relative delay in friction mobilization relative to the rate of cohesion loss as functions of plastic strain. This new brittleness index characterizes the entire stress–strain curve (pre- to post-peak stages) and represents the involved micro-mechanisms during the brittle failure process: that is, initiation, propagation, and coalescence of cracks. This study shows that brittleness of rock is the most dominant factor, in controlling breakout shape, which explains the failure of stress-based criteria adopted by many researchers in predicting the stress-induced breakout depth around openings.},

Accessing EQIL inventories and analyzing them concerning their potential causes is the key to explore such relation. However, each of the existing EQIL inventories has its level of completeness and associated uncertainty which makes any unified relationship which is challenging to obtain. So far, the completeness of EQIL inventories has never been clearly defined. As a result, it has never been accounted for in global EQIL predictive models. In this technical note, we propose a simple definition for the completeness of EQIL inventories. We analyze 30 digital EQIL for 21 earthquakes and develop a semi-quantitative method to estimate the completeness level, which we refer to as Completeness Index (CI). The CI results from a combination of topographic factors, ground shaking parameters, and a measure derived from landslide size statistics. The proposed CI consists of Low, Moderate, and High completeness classes which can be used to evaluate any landslide inventory. We made the whole procedure to compute the CI accessible in an ArcGIS toolbox together with a test dataset (see supplementary material).},

  abstract = {Determination of vertical slip rate on different timescales is one of the critical issues along north-trending rifts in Southern Tibet. The Yadong–Gulu rift, a typical example of these north-trending rifts, lacked sufficient quantitative data about the vertical slip rate along its southern portion. The southern Yadong–Gulu rift is comprised of the Relong, Nieru and the Pagri–Duoqing Co grabens, which are controlled by a normal fault along its eastern boundary. To determine the vertical slip rate, we measured the average height of fault scarps along the main fault trace and dated sediments displaced by the scarps by Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. The results indicated that the ages of these fault scarps clustered at late Pleistocene, and the vertical separation of scarps ranged from about 5.5\,m to 22\,m. After abandoning distinctly inaccurate displacements, we estimate that the average vertical slip rate of Relong graben is 0.7\,±\,0.1\,mm/yr and Nieru graben is 0.8\,±\,0.1\,mm/yr, while that of Pagri–Duoqing Co graben is 2.0\,±\,0.5\,mm/yr since the latest Quaternary (ca. 15\,ka) by weighting mean slip rate with error. It is considered that the different slip rates derive from the dispersed deformation of other faults around the Nieru and Relong graben and ductile deformation within the lower crust and northern Himalaya gneiss dome. Besides, the lack of large earthquakes in historical documents compared with the northern part of Yadong-Gulu rift, the inferred pattern of seismic migration and triggering of MHT to north-trending rifts, together indicate that the southern Yadong–Gulu rift is at high risks for middle to large earthquakes (M\,≥\,6) possibly.},

The lidar DEM consisted of nearly 2.8 million interpolated elevation values covering approximately100 ha and posted on an 0.6 m horizontal grid, from which a set of 16 maps was produced. The first subset of maps showed aspects of the topography useful for landslide mapping, an engineering geological map and a qualitative slope hazard map. The second subset consisted of physics-based probabilistic landslide hazard maps for wet static, wet seismic, and dry seismic conditions. This case history illustrates the utility of lidar-based products, supplemented by field-based geological observations and physics-based probabilistic slope stability modeling, for the evaluation of existing and potential slope stability hazards on a steep and heavily forested site.},

  abstract = {Water plays a first-order role in basal sliding of glaciers and ice sheets and is often a key constituent of accelerated glacier motion. Subglacial water is known to occupy systems of cavities and conduits at the interface between ice and the underlying bed surface, depending upon the history of water input and the characteristics of the substrate. Full understanding of the extent and configuration of basal water is lacking, however, because direct observation is difficult. This limits our ability to simulate ice dynamics and the subsequent impacts on sea-level rise realistically. Here we show that the subglacial hydrological system can have a large volume of water occupying basal crevasses that extend upward from the bed into the overlying ice. Radar and seismic imaging combined with in situ borehole measurements collected on Bench Glacier, Alaska, reveal numerous water-filled basal crevasses with highly transmissive connections to the bed. Some crevasses extend many tens of metres above the bed and together they hold a volume of water equivalent to at least a decimetre layer covering the bed. Our results demonstrate that the basal hydrologic system can extend high into the overlying ice mass, where basal crevasses increase water-storage capacity and could potentially modulate basal water pressure. Because basal crevasses can form under commonly observed glaciological conditions, our findings have implications for interpreting and modelling subglacial hydrologic processes and related sliding accelerations of glaciers and ice sheets.},

  abstract = {European mountain permafrost is generally only a few degrees below zero Celsius, and may therefore be highly sensitive to climate change. Permafrost degradation may lead to thaw settlement and reduction in the stability of mountain slopes. Engineering projects within the high mountain zone require careful investigations of potential permafrost-related hazards. This paper summarizes a staged approach to such investigations. Phase 1 involves walkover site survey supported by a desk study to define potential permafrost hazard zones. Data from permafrost distribution maps, topographic and geological maps are integrated, preferably using GIS methodology. If permafrost is possible and is judged to pose a significant threat to the development, phase 2 investigations are recommended whereby field thermal measurements, drilling of exploratory boreholes, and geophysical surveys are undertaken to clarify permafrost characteristics. The resulting data set should form an important component in subsequent engineering design. On a larger scale, a similar approach should be adopted as part of land-use planning within the mountain permafrost zone. Copyright  2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Results are presented from eight scaled centrifuge modelling experiments designed to investigate mass movement processes on thawing ice-rich slopes. Four pairs of simple planar slope models were constructed, one in each pair being of sufficient gradient to promote slope failure during soil thaw and the second having a gradient below the threshold for instability. Four frost susceptible soils were used, three were normally consolidated and had different clay contents (2\%, 12\% and 20\%) and the fourth comprised the 20\% clay soil, but was over consolidated prior to model testing. Modelling protocols included freezing from the surface downwards under an open hydraulic system, and thawing from the surface downwards under an enhanced gravitational field within the geotechnical centrifuge, thereby utilising scaling laws to simulate correct prototype self weight stresses during thaw. Slopes below the stability threshold gradient were subjected to between 2 and 4 cycles of freezing and thawing, simulating annual cycles. Those above the stability threshold were subjected to only one cycle, since they failed during the first thaw phase. Thermal conditions, pore water pressures, surface movements, and profiles of displacement are reported. Measured pore pressures are used in slope stability analyses based on a simple planar infinite slope model. Profiles of solifluction shear strain and mechanisms of slope failure are both shown to be sensitive to small changes in soil properties, particularly clay content and stress history. In all cases, pore pressures rose rapidly immediately following thaw, remained below the threshold for failure in low gradient models, but exceeding the threshold to trigger landslides on steeper slopes. Upward seepage of melt water away from the thaw front contributed to loss of shear strength. Mechanisms of slope failure differed between test soils, ranging from mudflow in non-cohesive silt to active layer detachment sliding in over consolidated silt–clay. During solifluction, shear strain was greatest at the surface in non-cohesive silt and decreased rapidly with depth, but in test soils containing clay, the zone of maximum shear strain was located lower in the displacement profiles.},

Using detailed landslide maps issued by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention of Japan, the mobility of 338 relic landslides was evaluated based on the H/L ratio, i.e., the equivalent coefficient of friction. The H/L ratio strongly correlates with the initial slope, tanθr (R2 = 0.78–0.88). The H/L ratio and tanθr of recent disaster-causing landslides within the past few decades were also measured in each investigated area. The data of recent landslides correspond to the 95\% lower prediction limit of the tanθr–H/L regression line for relic landslides. This result implies that morphometric analysis of relic landslides around an unstable mass allows for forecasting of travel distance of the unstable mass.},

The C3 basin underlain by Triassic bedded chert, while the S3 basin has evolved in altered Jurassic sandstone-shale. Continuing denudation rates were estimated from the records of coarse sediment transport and stream discharge for 6\,years (2004–2009), soil grain-size distribution, and dissolved load in stream water. A debris flow was observed and the volume was measured in C3 (chert). Concentrations of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al in fluvial sand were measured to determine spatially-averaged total denudation rates for these basins on the basis of steady-state assumption. Continuing denudation rate for C3 (chert) basin excluding the debris-flow mass accounted for \textasciitilde 75\% of the total denudation rate as measured from the cosmogenic nuclides. Assuming a difference between the total and continuing denudation rates indicates the impact of repeat debris flows, the debris flows with the observed magnitude (the mass of 24\,t) occur with the recurrence intervals of 100–550\,years (mean 167\,years) for C3 (chert) basin. For S3 (sandstone) basin, the continuous denudation rates were significantly smaller than the total rates, where debris flow had not occurred for at least 17\,years. The large gap in the denudation rates with different time scales shows contribution of higher magnitude debris-flow events with longer recurrence intervals.},

  abstract = {The Parkajoki area in northeastern Sweden is situated near the central area of Fennoscandian glaciation. Despite its location, the area is dominated by landforms induced by subaerial weathering and erosion processes, such as well-developed tors and associated saprolites, boulder fields, and boulder depressions. The glacial geomorphology is dominated by lateral and proglacial meltwater channels. Subglacial imprints indicative of thawed-bed conditions and reshaping by glacier sliding (e.g., fluting, drumlins, striae) are lacking. Hence, most of the landscape still exhibits a preglacial appearance. Because of its location, near the central area of glaciation, we attribute preservation to frozen-bed conditions of overriding ice sheets. The widespread distribution of well-developed tors and boulder fields, and the degree of chemical weathering of the bedrock, indicate that the area has been protected from glacial erosion during all glacial cycles since ice sheet initiation in the late Cenozoic. Unlike most other areas with tors in glaciated regions, the Parkajoki area is uniquely situated in the lowlands at 150 – 400 m.a.s.l. Moreover, this relict landscape is surrounded by glacial landscapes (including drumlins, ribbed moraine, and eskers) of varying age and at similar elevation. Hence, topographical reasons for this area being persistently cold-based cannot be invoked. By inference, we conclude that strain heat release never managed to cancel the initial subglacial permafrost conditions. We attribute this to divergent ice flow towards the convex outline of the ice sheet margin during deglaciations and to the relative roughness of the area compared to its surroundings. The implication is that to explain preservation throughout the Quaternary, all large-scale glaciations must have had a similar evolution concerning ice sheet configuration and internal dynamics as the last glaciation for which good constraints on evolution and outline are available.

  abstract = {Footwall slopes refer to unbenched rock slopes in which the slope face is parallel to a set of persistent discontinuities (e.g. bedding planes, foliation, faults). These are commonly encountered in weak, thinly bedded, orthogonally jointed, sedimentary rock sequences. Common failure mechanisms include bi-planar failures where shallow dipping crosscutting structures daylight near the slope toe, enabling sliding to occur along steep dipping bedding planes. In the absence of crosscutting structures, failure occurs through deformation and rock mass yielding involving the formation of inter block shear and toe breakout surfaces. Because of the complexity of the toe breakout mechanism, evaluation methods are not well understood. An improved understanding of the failure mechanism, the role of adverse discontinuities, and characterization of the discontinuity, intact rock and rock mass strength properties are key for a successful footwall stability analysis. This paper investigates the development of the inter block shear and toe breakout surfaces with three approaches: i) continuumbased frictional plasticity theory; ii) discontinuum-based distinct-element modelling with Voronoi tessellation using the commercial software UDEC; and iii) hybrid continuum/discontinuum finite-/discrete-element brittle fracture modelling using the commercial software ELFEN. Numerical simulations using ELFEN and UDEC demonstrated a good agreement with frictional plasticity theory. Ploughing failure of footwall slopes is also evaluated, specifically the influence of cross-cutting discontinuity dip angle relative to the slope face. The effects of different geometrical parameters (e.g., slope angle and depth/height ratio) on bi-planar and ploughing failure are assessed using a sensitivity analysis approach. A “Damage Intensity” parameter is introduced and used to quantify damage in the numerical simulations using ELFEN.},

  abstract = {A stream cut-bank at Flintstone Hill, Lauder Sandhills, Glacial Lake Hind Basin, southwestern Manitoba, exposes an extensive Holocene sedimentary sequence. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is used to determine lateral continuity of four major stratigraphic units (wetland complex, Mid-Holocene aeolian dune, sandsheet/fluvial, Late Holocene aeolian dune) and to image primary sedimentary features within the dune strata. Depth of GPR signal penetration is only about 5 m. Signal attenuation is attributed to the presence of primarily pedogenic silts/clays and carbonate- and iron sesquioxide-rich horizons within the sandier units. Nevertheless, the stratigraphic units are shown by GPR, and confirmed by core data, to be laterally continuous within the survey area. Finer-scale dune strata are not well displayed in the aeolian units. Signal attenuation above the Mid-Holocene unit and relatively high iron sesquioxide concentrations within the unit limit imaging of well-preserved dune foreset strata. In the Late Holocene unit, depositional strata are poorly preserved and GPR primarily images soil A-horizons formed on surfaces of temporary stabilization within the dune sediment.},

As a case study, the middle part of the Chriby Mountains (Czech Republic) widely affected by landslides was selected, with a total area of 147 km2. The landslide susceptibility assessment is based on the comparison and statistical elaboration of territorial dependence on input factors influencing the instability of the slopes. In this study, the lithology, slope angle, distance to stream, hypsographic level, and the current land cover were evaluated as the factors influencing slope stability and their susceptibility to sliding. The comparison shows that the high susceptibility to sliding is primarily in the areas of potential landslides and active, while 62 \% of existing slope failures are created in areas highly susceptible to sliding, 32 \% are in areas susceptible to moderate sliding. The remaining 6 \% of the landslides are located in low areas prone to sliding. This may be the accumulation parts of landslide bodies. An overall assessment of the 33 \% of the area can be classified as having a high degree of susceptibility to the sliding surface and 35 \% as moderately susceptible to landsliding. Low degree of susceptibility to sliding represents the remaining 32 \% area of the territory.},

Based on the theory that sliding force is greater than the shear resistance (resisting force) at the potential slip surface is the necessary and sufficient condition to occur the landslide as the sliding criterion, the principle and method for sliding force remote monitoring is presented, and the functional relationship between the human mechanical quantity and the natural sliding force is derived, hereby, the natural sliding force can be calculated according to the human mechanical quantity. Based on above principle and method, a new system of landslide remote monitoring is designed and 53 systems are installed on the landslide body in the Luoshan mining area, which make up the landslide remote monitoring network. According to the results of field test around 8 months, monitoring curves between sliding force and time are obtained, which can describe and forecast the develop trend of landslide. According to above analysis, the results show that this system has some following advantages: (1) real-time monitoring; (2) remote intelligent transmission; (3) landslides early warning.},

The valley was a major outlet of the former Patagonian Ice Sheet and the moraines that record its fluctuations are an important proxy record of climate change in southern South America. Such moraines are well-preserved in the Lago Pueyrredón valley owing in part to the semi-arid environment east of the mountain front. Here, we provide the first direct chronology for the age of the “Rio Blanco” moraine system by utilizing cosmogenic-nuclide surface exposure ages. Boulders on the moraines give 10Be exposure ages that indicate the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) maximum extent occurred by 27–25ka. Subsequent advances occurred at 23–22ka, 20–18ka, and ca. 18–17ka. Initial deglaciation began after ca. 18–17ka and was interrupted as evidenced by the Lago Columna moraines up-valley. Subsequently the outlet glaciers occupying both the Lago Pueyrredón basin (Chilean name: Lago Cochrane) and the Lago Buenos Aires basin (Chilean name: Lago General Carrera) to the north, rapidly retreated more than 80km at around 16.5–15ka. The timing of the LGM maximum extent and the onset of deglaciation occurred broadly synchronously throughout Patagonia. Deglaciation resulted in a series of interconnected glacier-dammed lakes in the region that initially drained toward the Atlantic Ocean and later drained to the Pacific Ocean as a consequence of disintegrating ice in the Andes.},

While several numerical models of large-scale fluvial erosion are available, there are only a few models of glacial erosion, and their application over long time spans requires a high numerical effort. In this paper, a simple formulation of glacial erosion which is similar to the fluvial stream-power model is presented. The model reproduces the occurrence of overdeepenings, hanging 5 valleys, and steps at confluences at least qualitatively. Beyond this, it allows for a seamless coupling to fluvial erosion and sediment transport. The recently published direct numerical scheme for fluvial erosion and sediment transport can be applied to the entire domain, where the numerical effort is only moderately higher than for a purely fluvial system. Simulations over several million years on lattices of several million nodes can be performed on standard PCs. An open-source implementation is freely available as a part of the landform evolution model OpenLEM.},

One reason for this simplification is the simple relationship of the constitutive law used here – often called stream-power law – to empirical results on longitudinal river profiles. Another no less important reason lies in the numerical effort that is much higher for transport-limited models than for detachment-limited models. This study proposes a formulation of transport-limited erosion where the relationship to empirical results on river profiles is almost as simple as it is for the stream-power law. As a central point, a direct solver for the fully implicit scheme is presented. This solver requires no iteration for the linear version of the model, allows for arbitrarily large time increments, and is almost as efficient as the established implicit solver for detachment-limited erosion. The numerical scheme can also be applied to linear hybrid models that cover the range between the two end-members of detachment-limited and transport-limited erosion.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Glaciers and ice sheets erode mountains and produce vast quantities of sediments that are delivered to rivers and oceans, impacting global sediment and biogeochemical balances. Therefore, understanding how the production of sediments by glacial erosion has evolved in the past, and will evolve in a changing climate, is increasingly important. In this Review, we examine the processes that control the magnitude and timing of glacial erosion of mountains, and how models can be used to reconstruct processes during the development of mountains. Field observations reveal the important role of sliding on the erosion rate, which provide an empirical basis to explain the glacial buzzsaw and the impact of late Cenozoic cooling on erosion rates. Glacial erosion is also expected to evolve in the context of anthropogenic climate warming, as both glacier sliding and the input of meltwater related to thinning and retreat of ice will change, with large effects on downstream ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. Thus, the mechanics and impacts of glaciers on sediment production warrant more research, especially in regions experiencing rapid warming. Above all, there is a need for better monitoring of how erosion rates changed over the last decades and will evolve in the future.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the effects of large massive rock-slope failures on subsequent slope stability. Three examples of large rockslope failures from the Austrian Alps and Norway demonstrate that failure increases the probability of further collapses. At Ko¨ fels, Austria, a Holocene rock-slope failure several km3 in size filled the O¨ tz valley. The morphology of the deposits indicates that at least one subsequent failure occurred along the head scarp of the first failure, most likely a slide of similar size. Debris of the second landslide slid over the older deposits, forming the famous Ko¨ fels frictionite. At least three rock-slope failures, all of them in excess of 106 m3, occurred from the same mountainside within the last 6000–8000 years at Tafjord in western Norway. The most recent of these failures in 1934, triggered a destructive tsunami. Five large failures with volumes z 50,000m3 occurred at Ramnefjell, Norway within 50 years; two of them caused considerable damage and a large number of death due to the formation of destructive tsunamis. Two-dimensional finite element models of rock-slope stability before and after the Ko¨ fels and Tafjord landslides show that massive rock-slope failures produce: (a) irregular slopes, parts of which are as steep or steeper than the slope before failure and which represent new zones of instability; and (b) zones of weakness related to slow slope deformation and related cracking.},

The 21Ne exposure ages of 8 superposed landslides with volumes Ͼ0.3 km3 are between ca. 150 and 430 ka, and indicate an average recurrence interval of large gravitational mountain-front failures of ϳ27.5 k.y. for the ultimate 7 landslides. Landsliding did not occur after 150 ka along this sector of the Sierra Laguna Blanca. The termination of landsliding activity correlates with reverse-fault propagation into the piedmont area of the Sierra Laguna Blanca. The exposure age of ca. 130 ka of a tectonically uplifted terrace postdates initiation of fault activity in the piedmont region, and the fault scarp height of 120 m indicates important continued uplift in the piedmont; no further offsets occurred at the mountain front. Due to this lack of tectonic activity at the mountain front, no further collapse has occurred, indicating that in this environment catastrophic mountain-front failure is mainly controlled by tectonically driven slope oversteepening.},

  abstract = {Generally landslide dams which exist for several hundreds to thousands of years are considered as stable. We show with an example from the Argentine Andes that such dams can exist for several thousands of years but still may fail catastrophically. Multiple rock avalanches impounded two lakes with surface areas of \textasciitilde 8 km2 and \textasciitilde 600 km2, respectively, in Las Conchas valley, NW Argentina. Surface exposure dating (SED) by 10Be of the rock-avalanche deposits or landslide scars indicates that these landslides occurred at 15,300€2,000 yr and 13,550€900 yr. The dams were stable during a strong earthquake, as suggested by seismites within related lake sediments and by multiple coeval landslides in this region, which occurred at \textasciitilde 7.5 kyr. However, when a further rock-avalanche fell into the lower, smaller lake at 4,800€500 yr the dam downriver was destroyed, presumably by the resulting tsunami wave. The resulting flood also destroyed an additional rock-fall dam which had formed at \textasciitilde 5,630 yr 14C cal BP 30 km downriver. The new dam formed by the second rock avalanche was eroded prior to 3,630 yr 14C cal BP. This dam erosion coincides with an important climatic shift towards more humid conditions in the Central Andes. Our results show that instead of direct effects of strong seismicity on landslide dams, (1) landsliding into a landslide-dammed lake, (2) abrupt hydrological changes, and (3) climate change towards conditions related to enhanced run-off are processes which can produce failures of “quasi-stable” natural dams.},

The spatial distribution of landslide deposits is not random, but it clusters along mountain fronts bounded by active faults. Inspection in the field reveals five principal controls on the distribution of these events. The source area of the rock avalanches has two topographic constraints: (1) vertical relief contrasts between the breakaway zone and the mountain front must exceed a threshold of 400 m, and (2) the slope inclinations must be steeper than 20°. Rock avalanches are restricted to three types of lithology: granites, low-grade metamorphic rocks, and coarse clastic sediments. Structural controls are very important. Rock avalanches are controlled by planar structures such as bedding planes, exfoliation joints, minor faults, and cleavage that all dip toward the valley. In addition, major slide clusters occur along mountain fronts that underwent Quaternary reverse-fault reactivation of former transfer faults with strike-slip kinematics. The trigger mechanism for the majority of these landslides is interpreted to be seismic, although the ages of some major slides are about 30 ka, and they may correspond to a more humid interval in southern South America.},

  abstract = {The paper examines the nature and geomorphic influences of deposits from rock avalanches that obstruct rivers. Most of the 115 rockslide–rock avalanche events identified in the Karakoram Himalaya straddled one or more stream valleys. At least 73 of these landslides formerly dammed the Indus or its tributaries. Upstream of the barriers, remnants exist of once very extensive lacustrine deposits. The stability and long-term survival of dams from large rock avalanches is addressed, and the reasons for the gradual or phased, rather than catastrophic and sudden, breaching. Case histories emphasise the erosional and depositional forms associated with the barriers. They are reconstructed in terms of the emplacement and properties of the deposits from rock avalanches, and the response of the river to interruption by them. These barriers have exerted a substantial control over stream response and development for most of the Holocene at least. Today, they are associated with distinctive features of channel form and thalweg, river terrace systems, intermontane sediment sinks and sources, and local erosional forms in bedrock. More broadly, the landslide barriers have created a naturally fragmented river system. Deposition and erosion in the lower few tens or hundreds of meters of the Upper Indus stream valleys have been dominated by epicycles of aggradation, trenching, and downcutting that mainly reflect the scale, timing and history of each barrier. The landforms involved are only indirectly related to the late-glacial and paraglacial conditions that have, hitherto, been regarded as the main explanation.},

  abstract = {This review examines interpretive issues relating to catastrophic, long-runout landslides in the context of large numbers of recently discovered late Quaternary events. It links relevant research in landslide science, including some novel or hitherto-ignored complexities in the nature and role of these events, to broader concerns of mountain geomorphology. Attention is drawn to mountain ranges known to have large concentrations of events. In particular, discoveries in three regions are singled out; the Karakoram Himalaya, the coastal mountains of northwestern North America, and the Southern Alps of New Zealand. In each region, many new events, or previously unrecognized complexities, have been identified in the past decade or two. Research on the sedimentology and geomorphology of prehistoric, eroded deposits has been critical to identifying rock avalanches, including many that were formerly attributed to other processes. Discoveries of rock avalanches in the ancient stratigraphic record have helped with the field recognition of rock-avalanche materials and in developing facies models of deposits with complex emplacement histories. The stratigraphic record also provides insights into interactions of streaming rock debris with deformable substrates. Such interactions are responsible for “landslide-tectonized” forms and transformation of rock avalanches into debris flows. Of special interest are runout geometries involving the interactions of rock avalanches with topography or substrate materials, and travel over glaciers. Other emerging issues relate to reconstruction of detachment-zone geometries, and slow, deep-seated slope movements that may trigger catastrophic failure. Most previous landslide studies have focused on individual events or general models, whereas the questions addressed here arise from a comparative approach emphasizing common and contrasting features among events in sets and in different regions. The scale and frequency of landslides in the regions of interest mean they have an important role in denudation, regional landform development, watershed evolution, and Quaternary environmental change. A major developmental factor, largely neglected, is persistent disturbance of high mountain fluvial systems by many successive landslides. Damming of streams and subsequent breaching of landslide barriers strongly influence inter-montane sedimentation and denudation, with particular significance in post-, para-, and inter-glacial contexts. Although an individual landslide appears as a “catastrophe” lasting only a minute or two, its legacy can persist as a morphogenetic influence for millennia or tens of millennia through disturbance of other processes. The influence is permanently felt; in effect, multiple events make the event a “normal” one in regions such as the three considered here.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) exposure dating of boulders is frequently used for rockslide chronology. A wellrecognized source of error that cannot be readily quantified is related to inheritance of TCN produced in the rock prior to failure. The effect of inheritance is not constant and will be greatest in the instance of a very recent shallow failure on a high-altitude surface with low event frequencies. We illustrate the effect by measuring 10Be concentrations in six boulders exposed for only 9 years before sampling, on a rock avalanche in Puerto Aysén, Chile. Their apparent exposure ages range from 216 ± 76 to 1755 ± 436 years. The mean apparent exposure age of a statistical cluster of three samples exceeds the real exposure time by 345 ± 36 years (3800\%), implying that all sampled rock surfaces experienced pre-failure TCN production. A reconstructed pre-failure topography enables the analysis of possible pre-failure boulder positions and an estimate of the range of possible inherited concentrations along a 2D transect. Despite a maximum failure-mass thickness of 110 m, the boulders seem to have originated from depths shallower than 14 m. Because of the likelihood that large boulders, prioritized for TCN sampling, originate from relatively shallow pre-failure depths owing to surface-near transport with minor turbation, it is necessary to consider potentially inherited TCN concentrations and their effect on the age determination, especially in cases of young rockslides, where the commonly adjusted effects of boulder erosion and snow, ash, or vegetation shielding are negligible in comparison.},

  abstract = {Oversteepened valley walls in western Norway have high recurrences of Holocene rock-slope failure activity causing significant risk to communities and infrastructure. Deposits from six to nine catastrophic rock-slope failure (CRSF) events are preserved at the base of the Mannen rock-slope instability in the Romsdal Valley, western Norway. The timing of these CRSF events was determined by terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating and relative chronology due to mapping Quaternary deposits. The stratigraphical chronology indicates that three of the CRSF events occurred between 12 and 10 ka, during regional deglaciation. Congruent with previous investigations, these events are attributed to the debuttressing effect experienced by steep slopes following deglaciation, during a period of paraglacial relaxation. The remaining three to six CRSF events cluster at 4.9 ± 0.6 ka (based on 10 cosmogenic 10Be samples from boulders). CRSF events during this later period are ascribed to climatic changes at the end of the Holocene thermal optimum, including increased precipitation rates, high air temperatures and the associated degradation of permafrost in rock-slope faces. Geomorphological mapping and sedimentological analyses further permit the contextualisation of these deposits within the overall sequence of post-glacial fjord-valley infilling. In the light of contemporary climate change, the relationship between CRSF frequency, precipitation, air temperature and permafrost degradation may be of interest to others working or operating in comparable settings.},

  abstract = {Assessing initiation of rock-slope deformation and paleo-slip rates of rockslides is important to understand the impact of climate variability - in particular permafrost changes - on rockslide activity. Norway, with 6–6.5\% permafrost cover today, continues to experience spatial and temporal variations in permafrost. We assess the timing of deformation initiation and potential late Pleistocene and Holocene sliding rates for six active gradually deforming rockslides in Norway using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide dating. We evaluate the timing and rates of deformation considering a possible climate control by modelling the permafrost evolution since deglaciation for three rockslide locations: Mannen, Revdalsfjellet and Gamanjunni 3. Deformation at these sites started during or at the end of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM), between 8 and 4.5 ka when permafrost in those regions was mostly degraded. At two low elevation sites, Oppstadhornet and Skjeringahaugane in western Norway, where permafrost remained absent during the Holocene, deformation started shortly after deglaciation. The timings suggest that the presence of permafrost in Norwegian rock slopes had a stabilizing effect over several millennia after deglaciation. Vertical transects of exposure ages along outcropping sliding surfaces indicate that pre-historical sliding rates seem to have decreased throughout the Holocene at all analysed rock-slope instabilities. However, modern measured sliding rates at four sites indicate a moderate to strong acceleration, compared to previous deformation rates. Three of these sites are located above or at the lower limit of alpine permafrost, where recent permafrost degradation may enhance slope destabilisation. The implication is that slope failures may become more frequent during accelerated warming in the Arctic and Subarctic.},

  abstract = {Denudation processes and sediment transfer are investigated in a high-elevation, low-relief environment (eastern Altiplano, Bolivia) using 10Be, 26Al, and in situ 14C analysis in fluvial sediments. Concentrations of the long-lived nuclides 10Be and 26Al yield consistently low catchment-wide denudation rates of \textasciitilde 3–29mmky−1 (integrating over 21–194ky), which reflect the low geomorphic gradients and the discontinuity of fluvial transport along the eastern Altiplano margin. No significant correlation is recorded between denudation rates of individual catchments and morphological basin parameters (slope, area, elevation). This is attributed to the overall little variability in morphology. The agreement between the denudation rates and published modern sediment discharge data suggests steady landscape evolution of the eastern Altiplano from the latest Pleistocene until today. While 10Be and 26Al provide long-term estimates on sediment production, in situ cosmogenic 14C is used to trace short-term sediment storage. In situ 14C concentrations are comparatively low indicating that 14C decayed during alluvial storage over at least the past \textasciitilde 11–20ky. We assume storage at shallow depth (2m) and consider the influence of soil-mantled hillslopes on the in situ 14C concentration. Our results illustrate the importance of sediment storage even over short distances and demonstrate the potential of in situ 14C to study sediment routing and transfer times within drainage systems. However, this study also demonstrates that the long-lived 10Be and 26Al nuclides can provide adequate estimates on long-term denudation rates even if sediment transport is not fast but interrupted by several thousands of years of storage.},

Multiple samples on single faults suggest that the development of this sackung started before 12 ka and that it is still active. We cannot exclude the possibility that the dissolution of the underlying Triassic evaporites participated in the sagging of Mt. Rognier. However, the age of this sackung and the presence of the Lauzière sackung on the other side of the Arcs valley support glacial erosion and debuttressing following the retreat of the valley glacier as the main causes of these large gravitational structures. The long and permanent activity of the Rognier sackung contrasts with that of the neighbouring Arcs sackung, which we previously dated using the same method and showed that it is a result of flexural toppling. Along with the proximity of the Rognier sackung to the Belledonne border active fault, its long history suggests that earthquake shaking contributed to maintain its activity. Additionally, two ages confirm that in the western Alps, rock glaciers formed mainly during the Younger Dryas. This study allowed the determination of the best sampling strategy for future CRE dating of these types of gravitational structures.},

  abstract = {Sackungs are the largest gravitational deformation observed in mountains. They are characterized by the long-term slowness of the movements, but their mechanism is still not well understood. Nowadays cosmic ray exposure (CRE) dating methods allow dating the morphologic structures involved in sackung and can contribute at the understanding of their origin. In the Alps, the 5.3 km long Arcs sackung initiated during the activity of rock glaciers. Three samples from these faulted rock glaciers provide their first CRE ages and show that at 2000 m elevation these block accumulations moved during the Younger Dryas and stopped in early Holocene. Six 10Be ages of fault scarps show that the Arcs sackung lasted only a few thousand years and stopped at about 8462 ± 432 10Be yr. They also reveal that deformation migrated upslope in agreement with a mechanism of flexural toppling of vertical layers. This unique and long gravitational event, characterized by migration of the deformation, does not support earthquake shaking as triggering mechanism for individual faults. It shows that, in the upper Isère valley, slope deformation was delayed of several thousand years after glacial debuttressing, and is not anymore active despite its fresh morphology.},

  abstract = {In the Western Alps, some recent scarps were previously interpreted as surface ruptures of tectonic reverse and normal faults that agree with microseismicity and GPS measurements. Our analysis shows that in fact there are hundreds of recent scarps, up to 30 m high and 2.1 km long, with only pure normal motions. They share the same characteristics as typical sackung scarps. The scarps are mainly uphill facing, parallel to the ridge crests and the contour lines. They are relatively short (less than 2.1 km) with respect to tectonic fault ruptures, and organized in swarms. They cut screes and relict rock glaciers with a slow (commonly 1 mm/year) average slip rate. In the Aiguilles Grives massif these sackung scarps clearly express the gravitational toppling of sub-vertical bedding planes in hard rocks. In contrast, the Belledonne Outer Crystalline Massif exhibits scarps that stem from the gravitational reactivation of conjugate tectonic faults. The recent faults extend to about 1600 m beneath the Rognier ridge crest, but are always above the valley floor. The main scarp swarm is 9.2 km long and constitutes the largest sackung ever described in the Western Alps.10Be dating of a scarp and offset surfaces shows that {$>$} 4 m slip may have occurred rapidly (in less than 3800 years) sometimes between the end of the glaciation and 8800 ± 1900 years ago. This dating, together with the location of some faults far from the deep glacial valleys, suggests that sagging might have been triggered by strong earthquakes during a post-glacial period of probably enhanced seismicity. The Belledonne and Synclinal Median faults (just beneath the Rognier sackung) could have been the sources of this seismicity.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The ability to model surface processes and to couple them to both subsurface and atmospheric regimes has proven invaluable to research in the Earth and planetary sciences. However, creating a new model typically demands a very large investment of time, and modifying an existing model to address a new problem typically means the new work is constrained to its detriment by model adaptations for a different problem. Landlab is an open-source software framework explicitly designed to accelerate the development of new process models by providing (1) a set of tools and existing grid structures – including both regular and irregular grids – to make it faster and easier to develop new process components, or numerical implementations of physical processes; (2) a suite of stable, modular, and interoperable process components that can be combined to create an integrated model; and (3) a set of tools for data input, output, manipulation, and visualization. A set of example models built with these components is also provided. Landlab's structure makes it ideal not only for fully developed modelling applications but also for model prototyping and classroom use. Because of its modular nature, it can also act as a platform for model intercomparison and epistemic uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. Landlab exposes a standardized model interoperability interface, and is able to couple to third-party models and software. Landlab also offers tools to allow the creation of cellular automata, and allows native coupling of such models to more traditional continuous differential equation-based modules. We illustrate the principles of component coupling in Landlab using a model of landform evolution, a cellular ecohydrologic model, and a flood-wave routing model.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The overall rock mass is highly heterogeneous and anisotropic owing to the combined effect of advanced weathering and severe tectonic stressing that gave rise to intense folding and shearing followed by extensional faulting, which resulted in highly weathered rock masses and numerous shear and/or mylonite zones with distinct downgraded engineering properties. This paper is focused on the applicability of the GSI classification system to these highly heterogeneous rock masses and proposes an extension of the GSI system to account for the foliated or laminated weak rocks in the lower range of its applicability.},

Field tests to determine this parameter directly are time consuming, expensive and the reliability of the results of these tests is sometimes questionable. Consequently, several authors have proposed empirical relationships for estimating the value of rock mass deformation modulus on the basis of classification schemes. These relationships are reviewed and their limitations are discussed. Based on data from a large number of in situ measurements from China and Taiwan a new relationship, based upon a sigmoid function, is proposed. The properties of the intact rock as well as the effects of disturbance due to blast damage and/or stress relaxation are also included in this new relationship.},

The criterion now incorporates both intact rock and discontinuities, such as joints, characterized by the geological strength index (GSI), into a system designed to estimate the mechanical behaviour of typical rock masses encountered in tunnels, slopes and foundations. The strength and deformation properties of intact rock, derived from laboratory tests, are reduced based on the properties of discontinuities in the rock mass. The nonlinear Hoek–Brown criterion for rock masses is widely accepted and has been applied in many projects around the world. While, in general, it has been found to provide satisfactory estimates, there are several questions on the limits of its applicability and on the inaccuracies related to the quality of the input data. This paper introduces relatively few fundamental changes, but it does discuss many of the issues of utilization and presents case histories to demonstrate practical applications of the criterion and the GSI system.},

The mobility of these landslides can be characterised with Fahrböschung (defined as the ratio of fall height H over runout distance L) and runout distance. Here we statistically analyze the effects of local topography on the mobility of rock avalanches using a database that includes 36 well-documented events that occurred in south-western China, half of which induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The analysis is conducted by distinguishing the three basic confinement categories of the rock avalanches, i.e. L-confined (laterally confined), U-confined (unconfined) and F-confined (frontally confined). The results of simple linear regression for H/L ratio and of multiple linear regression for runout distance L indicate that runout distance is preferable as a measure of mobility compared with H/L ratio due to the higher coefficient of determination. Moreover, the box-plots of residuals of the logarithm of runout distance indicated that frontal confinement tends to reduce runout distance, while lateral confinement enhances it. However, additional statistical analyses should be conducted exploiting a larger database of rock avalanches from a wider variety of environments.},

  abstract = {It is well known that diseases can greatly influence the morphology of plants, but often the incidence of disease is either too rare or the symptoms too obvious for the 'abnormalities' to cause confusion in systematics. However, we have recently come across several misinterpretations of disease-induced traits that may have been perpetuated into modern species inventories. Anther-smut disease (caused by the fungus Microbotryum violaceum) is common in many members of the Caryophyllaceae and related plant families. This disease causes anthers of infected plants to be filled with dark-violet fungal spores rather than pollen. Otherwise, their vegetative morphology is within the normal range of healthy plants. Here, we present the results of a herbarium survey showing that a number of type specimens (on which the species name and original description are based) in the genus Silene from Asia are diseased with anther smut. The primary visible disease symptom, namely the dark-violet anthers, is incorporated into the original species descriptions and some of these descriptions have persisted unchanged into modern floras. This raises the question of whether diseased type specimens have erroneously been given unique species names.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in interferometric radar remote sensing provide a method for deriving detailed topographic and slope information for fault-scarp detection. In October 1996, the airborne TOPSAR instrument [IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., 30 (1992) 933] was flown over southwest Nevada and east-central California. Topography calculated from TOPSAR data are in the form of a high-resolution (5-m spatial grid) digital elevation model (DEM). In this study, we focus upon the large, steep fault scarps that cut alluvium and alluvial fans in Fish Lake Valley, east of the White Mountains of Nevada – California. A series of topographic profiles extracted from the DEM reveal that the larger fault scarps are greater than 40 m in height and that the average midsection slope angle for all measured scarps is approximately 23j. These large scarps are the product of multiple offsets rather than a single event. Other relevant geomorphic features present in the digital topography include splays and benches along the main fault, levees, cutbanks, gullies incising fault scarp slopes, shutterridges, offset drainage, and small normal faults with scarp heights of only 4 – 6 m. Field work corroborated general geomorphologic landforms, confirmed fault-scarp morphometry, and aided the evaluation of the accuracy of the DEM. We are also able to assess fault segmentation models that divide the Fish Lake Valley fault zone (FLVFZ) into discrete segments based upon surface-rupture characteristics.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a new method for the digital mapping of taxonomic soil units via fuzzy taxonomy and fuzzy clustering. In principle, this respects the continuous character of the soil but can result in traditional crisp soil maps. A part of the Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mts. (Czech Republic) was the testing area. Fuzzified taxonomic soil information from 106 soil pits with 75 geomorphometric parameters (potential environmental covariates of soil units) derived from a 10 m LIDAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used for the input data. Another 60 soil pits were used for the validation of the results. Generalized linear models (GLM) of the relationship between fuzzified taxonomic soil information (membership of soil pits to particular soil types) and all geomorphometric parameters were used for the selection of 8 geomorphometric parameters as environmental covariates of soil taxonomic units (Catchment Slope, Elevation, Local Upslope Curvature, Gradient Difference, Melton Ruggedness Number, Slope Height, Modified Catchment Area, Multiresolution Index of Ridge Top Flatness). The fuzzy cmeans clustering of selected covariates led to the delimitation of soil-landscape units. The taxonomic meanings of the soil-landscape units (membership of the particular soil type to the particular type of soil-landscape unit) were determined on the basis of membership of soil pits to the soil types, and membership of the pixels with soil pits to the given type of soil-landscape unit. Every pixel obtained an individual membership to each soil type in this way. The defuzzification process (the assignment of a given pixel to only one resultant soil subtype) considered the first and second largest membership of pixels to particular soil types. To express the scientific reliability of the results, methods for measuring uncertainty and two modified confusion indexes are calculated. This approach shows 26\% full agreement, 64\% partial agreement and 10\% disagreement between the modelled and observed point data. The result significantly exceeds the accuracy of conventional soil maps in the tested area, as well as in some other previously investigated regions of the Western Carpathians.},

  abstract = {A rock avalanche deposit was investigated in order to understand the chronological evolution of geological hazards and to evaluate the interaction of the triggering geodynamic processes in the valley Val Viola, Italian Alps. The deposit is situated west of the Alpe Dosde´ , in a permafrost area with deep-seated gravitational deformations (DSGD) along a tectonic line. Based on its geomorphologic context, the rock avalanche was first interpreted as a result of slope stress release without exact timing. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the 10Be exposure date of quartz from one boulder from the rock avalanche. The age of 74307460 years places the event in the early Holocene. The timing of the last deglaciation was constrained using the inner late glacial moraine of a moraine doublet in the valley Alpe Dosde´ situated at an altitude between 2140 and 2120 m a.s.l. west of the rock avalanche. The 10Be concentrations of quartz yield minimum exposure ages of 11,4807670 and 10,8507820 years. Different proposals for potential triggering factors of the rock avalanche include (a) melting of the local valley glacier and slope stress release in the Val Viola, likely to play a minor role as trigger, because of the time delay between the deglaciation and the rock avalanche event. More likely are (b) enhanced crustal seismicity induced by post-glacial regional isostatic glacial rebound coupled with tectonic stress or/and (c) climate conditions with higher temperatures around 74307460 years, resulting in an upwards movement of the permafrost limit and destabilization of the rock walls.},

In the western Southern Alps of New Zealand landslides are scale invariant and have a power-law magnitude frequency distribution. Independent studies from other regions suggest that this is a general property of landsliding. This observation is of critical importance to the evaluation of the impact of events of different length scales over different time intervals on landscape evolution. It is particularly useful when estimating regional geomorphic rates, because it constrains the frequency and overall significance of extreme events, which cannot otherwise be evaluated. By integrating the complete response of the system, we estimate the regional denudation rate due to landsliding to be 9 ± 4 mm yr–1. Sediment discharge from the western Southern Alps is dominated by landslide-derived material.},

The DEMs are registered to satellite radar and laser altimetry and are mosaicked to provide a continuous surface covering nearly 95 \% the entire continent. The mosaic includes an error estimate and a time stamp, enabling change measurement. Typical elevation errors are less than 1 m, as validated by the comparison to airborne laser altimetry. REMA provides a powerful new resource for Antarctic science and provides a proof of concept for generating accurate high-resolution repeat topography at continental scales.},

  abstract = {Gravitational spreading of mountain ridges displays primary disequilibrium of flysch mountain areas of the Czech Carpathians. The progression of various types of mass movements is a product of long-term ridge disintegration and is predisposed by the geological structure of the area and the upper Tertiary-Quaternary morphogenesis of the mountain area. Deep-seated slope deformations are spatially interconnected by the occurrence of some other types of slope deformations (e.g. debris flows, debris slides, slumps, rock avalanches, etc.), which pose a considerable risk for the existence of human society. An important causative factor in these dynamically developing hazardous processes is, among other factors, the way in which land has been used in the last three centuries. Therefore, the occurrence of various types of slope deformations is studied in terms of their relation to deep-seated gravitational deformations and in terms of other limiting factors (structural geological, morphological and climatic factors, manmade impacts, etc.). The paper presents several case studies of slope deformations (Velka´ Cˇ antoryje Mt, Lysa´ hora Mt, Ropice Mt and Smrk Mt) in the area of the Outer Carpathians within the territory of the Czech Republic and also adverts to some consequences in terms of the socioeconomic structure of the landscape.},

  abstract = {Large rockfalls commonly generate fast-moving streams of debris that have been called "sturzstroms." The geometry of sturzstrom deposits is similar to that of mudflows, lava flows, and glaciers. Sturzstroms can move along a flat course for unexpectedly large distances and may surge u p w a r d by the p o w e r of their momentum. A currently popular hypothesis to account for their excessive distance of transport suggests that sturzstroms slide on air cushions. Contrary to that hypothesis, evidence is herein presented to support Heim's contention that sturzstroms indeed flow.},

  abstract = {Geometry of planner geological structures can interact with topographic slope and cause different types of slope failure (e.g. wedge failure, dip slope failure, and toppling etc.). This study focus on how the tectonic foliation influences the landslide pattern in the southern Central Range of Taiwan. The tectonic foliations in this area range from pencil cleavage to schistosity depending on the increasing of metamorphic grade, and different foliations have different influences on the landslide behaviors. To describe the relation between foliation and topographic slope, we create the θD value as the angle between the foliation dip direction azimuth and the topographic downslope direction azimuth at a given location. The location of landslides in the area with pencil cleavage has no preferential θD value, and it suggests the landslide distribution has no correlation with foliation. The location of landslides in the area with well-developed slaty cleavage is mostly in the lower θD value, which suggests the landslides are more likely located in the area where the foliation dip direction is parallel to the topographic downslope direction. The location of landslide in the area with schistosity is mostly in the high θD value area, which suggests the landslides are more likely located in the area where the foliation dip direction is opposite to the topographic downslope direction.},

  abstract = {The exponent decay in landslide frequency-area distribution is widely used for assessing the consequences of landslides and with some studies arguing that the slope of the exponent decay is universal and independent of mechanisms and environmental settings. However, the documented exponent slopes are diverse and hence data processing is hypothesized for this inconsistency. An elaborated statistical experiment and two actual landslide inventories were used here to demonstrate the influences of the data processing on the determination of the exponent. Seven categories with different landslide numbers were generated from the predefined inverse-gamma distribution and then analyzed by three data processing procedures (logarithmic binning, LB, normalized logarithmic binning, NLB and cumulative distribution function, CDF). Five different bin widths were also considered while applying LB and NLB. Following that, the maximum likelihood estimation was used to estimate the exponent slopes. The results showed that the exponents estimated by CDF were unbiased while LB and NLB performed poorly. Two binning-based methods led to considerable biases that increased with the increase of landslide number and bin width. The standard deviations of the estimated exponents were dependent not just on the landslide number but also on binning method and bin width. Both extremely few and plentiful landslide numbers reduced the confidence of the estimated exponents, which could be attributed to limited landslide numbers and considerable operational bias, respectively. The diverse documented exponents in literature should therefore be adjusted accordingly. Our study strongly suggests that the considerable bias due to data processing and the data quality should be constrained in order to advance the understanding of landslide processes.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the temporal variation of rainfall-triggered landslide hazard within the broader context of natural risk evolution. Analysis of a sequence of aerial photos covering a period of 60~years allowed the establishment of a record of landsliding for a site in the Wellington region, New Zealand. The data show one very dominant peak in the magnitude of landslide occurrence in the late 1970s, followed by a continuous decrease. Landslide hazard can be expressed by the frequency and magnitude of the landslide events, with the total surface area affected used as a surrogate for magnitude. However, the distinct decline of landslide magnitude through time from the 1980s onwards indicates that landslide hazard may change with time. This possibility is further explored by correlating potential landslide triggering storms with the magnitude of the landslide event, using the ‘Antecedent Soil Water Status’ model in combination with daily rainfall. The relation between magnitudes of rainfall and magnitudes of landslide events is found to be weak, suggesting that a given ‘Critical Water Content’ (antecedent soil water status and rainfall on the day) does not produce similar magnitudes of landsliding. Furthermore, the study shows that reactivation of previous landslides before the peak landslide occurrence of the late 1970s is low, while the situation is reversed after this peak and reactivation in the subsequent years plays a larger role. It is concluded that the pattern of landsliding cannot be explained by the pattern of rainfall and other factors are controlling the variation of landslide hazard in time. A possible explanation is a change of the geomorphological system with time, instigated by a massive period of landsliding (the late 1970s peak). Subsequent sediment exhaustion of source areas resulting from this period appears to alter the system’s subsequent reaction to an external trigger such as rainfall. The study demonstrates that landslide hazard analysis in general should not rely on the integral of the frequency–magnitude relationship only, but should include potential non-linear changes of system settings to increase the understanding of future system behaviour, and therefore hazard and risk.},

  abstract = {Climate change, manifested by an increase in mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures and by more intense rainstorms, is becoming more evident in many regions. An important consequence of these changes may be an increase in landslides in high mountains. More research, however, is necessary to detect changes in landslide magnitude and frequency related to contemporary climate, particularly in alpine regions hosting glaciers, permafrost, and snow. These regions not only are sensitive to changes in both temperature and precipitation, but are also areas in which landslides are ubiquitous even under a stable climate. We analyze a series of catastrophic slope failures that occurred in the mountains of Europe, the Americas, and the Caucasus since the end of the 1990s. We distinguish between rock and ice avalanches, debris flows from de-glaciated areas, and landslides that involve dynamic interactions with glacial and river processes. Analysis of these events indicates several important controls on slope stability in high mountains, including: the non-linear response of firn and ice to warming; three-dimensional warming of subsurface bedrock and its relation to site geology; de-glaciation accompanied by exposure of new sediment; and combined short-term effects of precipitation and temperature. Based on several case studies, we propose that the following mechanisms can significantly alter landslide magnitude and frequency, and thus hazard, under warming conditions: (1) positive feedbacks acting on mass movement processes that after an initial climatic stimulus may evolve independently of climate change; (2) threshold behavior and tipping points in geomorphic systems; (3) storage of sediment and ice involving important lag-time effects.

Steller rock–ice avalanche in Alaska, and ice and rock avalanches at Monte Rosa, Italy in 2005 and 2007. Deposit volumes range from 106 to 108 m3 and include rock, ice and snow. Here we focus on thermal aspects of these failures reflecting the involvement of glacier ice and permafrost at all sites, suggesting that thermal perturbations likely contributed to the slope failures. We use surface and troposphere air temperatures, near-surface rock temperatures, satellite thermal data, and recent 2D and 3D thermal modeling studies to document thermal conditions at the landslide sites. We distinguish between thermal perturbations of volcanic-geothermal and climatic origin, and thermal perturbations related to glacier–permafrost interaction. The data and analysis support the view that recent, current and future climatic change increases the likelihood of large slope failures in steep glacierized and permafrost terrain. However, some important aspects of these settings such as the geology and tectonic environment remain poorly understood, making the identification of future sites of large slope instabilities difficult. In view of the potentially large natural disasters that can be caused by such slope failures, improved data and understanding are needed.},

  abstract = {We investigate the role and relative importance of a range of geometric and mechanical factors in the development of contractional fault-related folds, with an emphasis on defining the factors that promote the development of fault-bend and fault-propagation folds. We construct a series of discrete-element mechanical models in order to test the effects of fault dip, bulk material strength, mechanical layer anisotropy and spacing, sedimentation rate, and boundary conditions on the style of fault-related fold that develops. We find that fault-bend folding is most favored at low fault ramp dips, with thinly-spaced mechanical layers, and strong layer strength contrasts. In contrast, conditions that inhibit slip on a potential upper detachment surface, such as increased friction and a fixed foreland boundary, encourage the development of fault-propagation folds. Additionally, steeper fault dips, more widely-spaced mechanical layers, and decreased layer strength contrast favor the increased localization of shear during the growth of structures. This leads to structures that deform by a mixture of fault-bend and faultpropagation folding styles. Observations of the distortional strains that develop in the model provide insight into the relationship between the different deformation mechanisms, such as flexural slip and localized shear, which accommodate structural growth and ultimately determine fault-related folding style. Thus, these models provide a context for understanding how rock and fault properties influence whether structures evolve as fault-bend or fault-propagation folds, or as combinations of these end members. We apply these insights to interpret two natural examples from the offshore Niger Delta outer fold-and-thrust belt that exhibit changes in structural style through time as a result of changes in fault properties and syntectonic sedimentation.},

  abstract = {We present surface evidence and displacement rates for a young, active, low-angle (∼20°) reverse thrust fault in close proximity to major population centers in southern California (USA), the Southern San Cayetano fault (SSCF). Active faulting along the northern flank of the Santa Clara River Valley displaces young landforms, such as late Quaternary river terraces and alluvial fans. Geomorphic strain markers are examined using field mapping, high-resolution lidar topographic data, 10Be surface exposure dating, and subsurface well data to provide evidence for a young, active SSCF along the northern flank of the Santa Clara River Valley. Displacement rates for the SSCF are calculated over 103–104 yr timescales with maximum slip rates for the central SSCF of 1.9+1.0−0.5 mm\,yr−1 between ∼19–7 ka and minimum slip rates of 1.3+0.5−0.3 mm\,yr−1 since ∼7 ka. Uplift rates for the central SSCF have not varied significantly over the last ∼58 ka, with a maximum value of 1.7+0.9−0.6 mm\,yr−1 for the interval ∼58–19 ka, and a minimum value of 1.2±0.3 mm\,yr−1 since ∼7 ka. The SSCF is interpreted as a young, active structure with onset of activity at some time after ∼58 ka. The geometry for the SSCF presented here, with a ∼20° north dip in the subsurface, is the first interpretation of the SSCF based on geological field data. Our new interpretation is significantly different from the previously proposed model-derived geometry, which dips more steeply at 45–60° and intersects the surface in the middle of the Santa Clara River Valley. We suggest that the SSCF may rupture in tandem with the main San Cayetano fault. Additionally, the SSCF could potentially act as a rupture pathway between the Ventura and San Cayetano faults in large-magnitude, multi-fault earthquakes in southern California. However, given structural complexities, including significant changes in dip and varying Holocene displacement rates along strike, further work is required to examine the possible mechanism, likelihood, and frequency of potential through-going ruptures between the Ventura and San Cayetano faults. Confirmation of the SSCF in a previously well-studied area, such as southern California, demonstrates that identification of young faults is critical for accurate seismic hazard assessment. We suggest that many young, active faults remain undetected in other structurally complex and tectonically active regions globally, and that significant seismic hazards can be overlooked.},

  abstract = {Glaciers distinct from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking rapidly, altering regional hydrology1, raising global sea level2 and elevating natural hazards3. Yet, owing to the scarcity of constrained mass loss observations, glacier evolution during the satellite era is known only partially, as a geographic and temporal patchwork4,5. Here we reveal the accelerated, albeit contrasting, patterns of glacier mass loss during the early twenty-first century. Using largely untapped satellite archives, we chart surface elevation changes at a high spatiotemporal resolution over all of Earth’s glaciers. We extensively validate our estimates against independent, high-precision measurements and present a globally complete and consistent estimate of glacier mass change. We show that during 2000–2019, glaciers lost a mass of 267~±~16 gigatonnes per year, equivalent to 21~±~3 per cent of the observed sea-level rise6. We identify a mass loss acceleration of 48~±~16 gigatonnes per year per decade, explaining 6 to 19 per cent of the observed acceleration of sea-level rise. Particularly, thinning rates of glaciers outside ice sheet peripheries doubled over the past two decades. Glaciers currently lose more mass, and at similar or larger acceleration rates, than the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets taken separately7–9. By uncovering the patterns of mass change in many regions, we find contrasting glacier fluctuations that agree with the decadal variability in precipitation and temperature. These include a North Atlantic anomaly of decelerated mass loss, a strongly accelerated loss from northwestern American glaciers, and the apparent end of the Karakoram anomaly of mass gain10. We anticipate our highly resolved estimates to advance the understanding of drivers that govern the distribution of glacier change, and to extend our capabilities of predicting these changes at all scales. Predictions robustly benchmarked against observations are critically needed to design adaptive policies for the local- and regional-scale management of water resources and cryospheric risks, as well as for the global-scale mitigation of sea-level rise.},

  abstract = {Numerical dating of glacial deposits is important for understanding Quaternary glacial evolution. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating is one of the techniques widely used on such sediments. Owing to the short distances traveled before deposition, the incomplete bleaching of luminescence signals in glacial sediments may introduce serious dating problems vis-a -vis glacial and any associated sediments. Here, we report a comparison of OSL ages obtained from the fine (4e11 mm) and medium (38 e63 mm) grain size fractions of quartz extracted from glaciofluvial sediments and from glacial tills in the Basongcuo catchment near the eastern Himalayan syntaxis. Initially, four glacial stages were identified based on field observations of moraine distribution and geomorpho-stratigraphic relations. A total of 39 OSL samples were then collected from glaciofluvial sand layers or lenses and from till. Quartz grains in the fine (4e11 mm) and medium (38e63 mm) size fractions were extracted from each sample, and dated using the single-aliquot regeneration (SAR) protocol. The modern supraglacial sediment sample was dated to \textasciitilde 0.2 (fine grain) to \textasciitilde 0.7 (medium grain) ka, suggesting that the sediment was not completely bleached on deposition. Contrary to previous experience suggesting that coarse grains are usually better bleached than fine grains prior to deposition, our results show that estimated OSL ages for fine grains are generally younger than those for medium grains. This suggests that the two fractions may have come from different sources and thus have different bleaching histories, and that fine-grained quartz may be more suitable for OSL dating of these materials. Applying the minimum age model to data from mediumgrained quartz yields ages close to those obtained from fine-grained quartz, suggesting that both can be used for dating glacial advances. The OSL dates suggest that glaciers in the studied area advanced at 0.1 e1.3 ka, \textasciitilde 7.5 ka and 11e13 ka, and were furthest advanced between \textasciitilde 16 and \textasciitilde 30 ka. The timing of the local Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is broadly consistent throughout the eastern and central Himalaya and frequent glacial advances after the LGM. All suggest that glaciers in the humid eastern Himalayan syntaxis are sensitive to global cooling.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a structural investigation of the Turtle Mountain anticline (Alberta, Canada) to better understand the role of the different tectonic features on the development of both local and large scale rock slope instabilities occurring in Turtle Mountain. The study area is investigated by combining remote methods with detailed field surveys. In particular, the benefit of Terrestrial Laser Scanning for ductile and brittle tectonic structure interpretations is illustrated. The proposed tectonic interpretation allows the characterization of the fracturing pattern, the fold geometry and the role of these tectonic features in rock slope instability development. Ten discontinuity sets are identified in the study area, their local variations permitting the differentiation of the study zone into 20 homogenous structural domains. The anticline is described as an eastern verging fold that displays considerable geometry differences along its axis and developed by both flexural slip and tangential longitudinal strain folding mechanisms. Moreover, the origins of the discontinuity sets are determined according to the tectonic phases affecting the region (pre-folding, folding, post-folding). The localization and interpretation of kinematics of the different instabilities revealed the importance of considering the discrete brittle planes of weakness, which largely control the kinematic release of the local instabilities, and also the rock mass damage induced by large tectonic structures (fold hinge, thrust).},

  abstract = {Existing limit equilibrium methods, routinely used to calculate the stability of rock slopes, do not satisfy rotational equilibrium of the potential slide around a vertical axis. This is inconsequential for slides that are symmetrical with respect to a vertical plane oriented in the direction of motion. In this paper, methods are developed to analyse the stability of strongly asymmetric slides, defined by a weak sliding surface dipping in an oblique downslope direction and a stronger vertical plane forming one of the lateral boundaries (‘‘constraint surface’’). It is shown that tensile bending stresses can develop on the constraint in some cases. If the rock mass cannot sustain tension and if tensile rock mass failure destroys the cohesion (e.g. by the formation of cracks), the sliding Factor of Safety can be very substantially reduced. Under certain conditions, a rotation failure can occur irrespective of the shear strength available on the constraint. Routinely used analysis, such as the wedge stability method, can err substantially on the unsafe side. Two new methods are presented: a simple closed form solution of a quadrilateral block and a numerical ‘‘Method of Columns’’ solution applicable to general surfaces. The results are compared with an advanced discontinuous stress–strain solution of an asymmetric wedge example.},

The primary recommendation is to modify the definition of landslide-forming materials, to provide compatibility with accepted geotechnical and geological terminology of rocks and soils. Other, less important modifications of the classification system are suggested, resulting from recent developments of the landslide science. The modified Varnes classification of landslides has 32 landslide types, each of which is backed by a formal definition. The definitions should facilitate backward compatibility of the system as well as possible translation to other languages. Complex landslides are not included as a separate category type, but composite types can be constructed by the user of the classification by combining two or more type names, if advantageous.},

  abstract = {Linking landslide size and frequency is important at both human and geological timescales for quantifying both landslide hazards and the effectiveness of landslides in the removal of sediment from evolving landscapes. The statistical behaviour of the magnitude-frequency of landslide inventories is usually compiled following a particular triggering event such as an earthquake or storm, and their statistical behaviour is often characterised by a power-law relationship with a small landslide rollover. The occurrence of landslides is expected to be influenced by the material properties of rock and/or regolith in which failure occurs. Here we explore the statistical behaviour and the controls of a secular landslide inventory (SLI) (i.e. events occurring over an indefinite geological time period) consisting of mapped landslide deposits and their underlying lithology (bedrock or superficial) across the United Kingdom. The magnitude-frequency distribution of this secular inventory exhibits an inflected power-law relationship, well approximated by either an inverse gamma or double Pareto model. The scaling exponent for the power-law scaling of medium to large landslides is α = −1.71 ± 0.02. The small-event rollover occurs at a significantly higher magnitude (1.0–7.0 × 10−3 km2) than observed in single-event landslide records (∼ 4 × 10−3 km2). We interpret this as evidence of landscape annealing, from which we infer that the SLI underestimates the frequency of small landslides. This is supported by a subset of data where a complete landslide inventory was recently mapped. Large landslides also appear to be under-represented relative to model predictions. There are several possible reasons for this, including an incomplete data set, an incomplete landscape (i.e. relatively steep slopes are under-represented), and/or temporal transience in landslide activity during emergence from the last glacial maximum toward a generally more stable late-Holocene state. The proposed process of landscape annealing and the possibility of a transient hillslope response have the consequence that it is not possible to use the statistical properties of the current SLI database to rigorously constrain probabilities of future landslides in the UK.},

The ERT technique was applied using four lines over and outside of the landslide scar using the Wenner electrode configuration. The SRT study was performed along four longitudinal profiles coincident with the ERT lines.

We use geomorphology and cosmogenic 36Cl exposure dating of boulders to divide the Marocche di Dro deposits into two rock avalanche bodies; the Marocca Principale to the north and the Kas to the south. The deposits were previously undated and had been mapped as up to five different events. The largest event Marocca Principale, which comprises an estimated 1000 106 m3 of predominantly Rotzo Formation limestones, occurred 5300 ± 860 yr ago. The release area is located mainly in the alcove between Mt. Casale and Mt. Granzoline, but likely extends all the way to Mt. Brento. The Kas event took place 1080 ± 160 yr ago with detachment below Mt. Brento. The Kas debris, with an estimated volume of 300 106 m3, buried the southern third of the Marocca Principale deposit. Kas presents a barren, stark landscape dominated by house-sized Tovel Member Rotzo Formation boulders bearing distinctive chert lenses. Both the extreme relief of the rock wall (more than 1300 m) and the tectonic setting predispose the range front to massive failure. For the two events, initially translational movement likely quickly evolved into complex failure and massive collapse.

  abstract = {In the last decades surface exposure dating using cosmogenic nuclides has emerged as a powerful tool in Quaternary geochronology and landscape evolution studies. Cosmogenic nuclides are produced in rocks and sediment due to reactions induced by cosmic rays. Landforms ranging in age from a few hundred years to tens of millions of years can be dated (depending on rock or landform weathering rates) by measuring nuclide concentrations. In this paper the history and theory of surface exposure dating are reviewed followed by an extensive outline of the fields of application of the method. Sampling strategies as well as information on individual nuclides are discussed in detail. The power of cosmogenic nuclide methods lies in the number of nuclides available (the radionuclides 10Be, 14C, 26Al, and 36Cl and the stable noble gases 3He and 21Ne), which allows almost every mineral and hence almost every lithology to be analyzed. As a result focus can shift to the geomorphic questions.

  abstract = {Sixteen boulder and bedrock surfaces related to the Flims landslide (volume 8–12 km3) were dated with 36Cl and 10Be. Exposure ages range from 4900 ± 250 yr to 15,440 ± 1480 yr, including corrections made due to snow cover and karst erosion. Ages of 11,410 ± 590 yr and 13,340 ± 1090 yr were obtained on bedrock surfaces outside of the landslide zone. These are minima for deglaciation of Segnes valley and provide constraints on possible amounts of inherited nuclides. Based on seven boulder ages, which range from 8200 ± 260 to 9520 ± 990 yr, a mean of 8900 ± 700 years is calculated for the Flims landslide. We exclude three outliers (one significantly older and two significantly younger than the others) and the ages from the Cassons bedrock site from the mean calculation. The latter is excluded as shielding due to snow and vegetation cover is difficult to constrain there. The oldest boulder on the landslide yielded an age (15440 ± 1480 yr) more than 5000 years older than any other boulder age, suggesting that it included the surface of the pre-slide bedrock. The exposure ages are consistent with a single failure event. The erratics and patches of till lying on the landslide debris must have been carried piggy-back on top of the landslide rather than having been deposited by the late Pleistocene Vorderrhein Glacier. The Flims rockslide is about the same age as the Köfels (9800 yr) and Kandertal (9600 yr) rockslides. All three occurred during the marked transition to warmer, wetter conditions during the early Holocene.},

  abstract = {An iterative procedure that implements the classification of continuous topography as a problem in digital image-processing automatically divides an area into categories of surface form; three taxonomic criteria–slope gradient, local convexity, and surface texture–are calculated from a square-grid digital elevation model (DEM). The sequence of programmed operations combines twofold-partitioned maps of the three variables converted to greyscale images, using the mean of each variable as the dividing threshold. To subdivide increasingly subtle topography, grid cells sloping at less than mean gradient of the input DEM are classified by designating mean values of successively lower-sloping subsets of the study area (nested means) as taxonomic thresholds, thereby increasing the number of output categories from the minimum 8 to 12 or 16. Program output is exemplified by 16 topographic types for the world at 1-km spatial resolution (SRTM30 data), the Japanese Islands at 270~m, and part of Hokkaido at 55~m. Because the procedure is unsupervised and reflects frequency distributions of the input variables rather than pre-set criteria, the resulting classes are undefined and must be calibrated empirically by subsequent analysis. Maps of the example classifications reflect physiographic regions, geological structure, and landform as well as slope materials and processes; fine-textured terrain categories tend to correlate with erosional topography or older surfaces, coarse-textured classes with areas of little dissection. In Japan the resulting classes approximate landform types mapped from airphoto analysis, while in the Americas they create map patterns resembling Hammond's terrain types or surface-form classes; SRTM30 output for the United States compares favorably with Fenneman's physical divisions. Experiments are suggested for further developing the method; the Arc/Info AML and the map of terrain classes for the world are available as online downloads.},

  abstract = {We undertake digital terrain analyses of rainfall- and earthquake-induced landslides in Japan, using high-resolution orthoimagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) DEMs. Our aims are twofold: to demonstrate an effective method for dealing with high-resolution DEMs, which are often too detailed for landslide assessments, and to evaluate the topographic differences between rainfall- and earthquake-induced landslides. The study areas include the Izumozaki (1961 and 2004 heavy rainfalls), Niihama (2004 heavy rainfalls), Houfu (2009 heavy rainfalls), and Hanokidachi/Kurikoma-dam regions (the 2008 M 7.2 Iwate–Miyagi Nairiku earthquake). The study areas include 7,106 landslides in these five regions. We use two topographic attributes (the slope gradient and the Laplacian) calculated from DEMs in varying window sizes. The hit rates for statistical prediction of landslide cells through discriminant analyses are calculated using the two topographic attributes as explanatory variables, and the landslide inventory data as the dependent variable. In cases of surface failure, the hit rates are found to diminish when the window size of the topographic attributes is too large or too small, indicating that an optimal scale factor is key in assessing shallow landslides. The representative window sizes are approximately 30 m for shallow landslides; the optimal window size may be directly related to the average size of landslides in each region. We also find a stark contrast between rainfall- and earthquake-induced landslides. Rainfall-induced landslides are always most common at a slope gradient of 30°, but the frequency of earthquake-induced landslides increases exponentially with slope gradient. We find that the Laplacian, i.e., the attributes of surface convexity and concavity, and the slope gradient are both important factors for rainfall-induced landslides, whereas earthquake-induced landslides are influenced mainly by slope steepness.},

Assuming that the main discontinuity sets, including bedding, control part of the slope morphology, the structural features of Turtle Mountain were investigated using a digital elevation model (DEM). Using new landscape analysis techniques, we have identified three main joint and fault sets. These results are in agreement with those sets identified through field observations. Landscape analysis techniques, using a DEM, confirm and refine the most recent geology model of the Frank Slide. The rockslide was initiated along bedding and a fault at the base of the slope and propagated up slope by a regressive process following a surface composed of pre-existing discontinuities. The DEM analysis also permits the identification of important geological structures along the 1903 slide scar.},

These applications are classified as: (1) Detection and characterization of mass movements; (2) Hazard assessment and susceptibility mapping; (3) Modelling; (4) Monitoring. This review emphasizes how LIDARderived HRDEMs can be used to investigate any type of landslides. It is clear that such HRDEMs are not yet a common tool for landslides investigations, but this technique has opened new domains of applications that still have to be developed.},

With the minimum age of 47704 ± 2346 cal b2k, the landslide belongs among the oldest dated landslides in the outer Western Carpathians and Carpathian Foredeep in the Czech Republic. The younger reactivation started at 12662 ± 73 cal b2k during Younger Dryas. The palaeobotanical and depositional record from the landslide brought unique palaeoenvironmental data for two time intervals of the last Quaternary climatic cycle. The reconstructed MIS 3 forest vegetation with the predominance of stone pine-larch (Pinus cembra e Larix) taiga with Pinus sylvestris and Betula pendula/pubescens are the first evidences of the forest vegetation for the GS13 to GI12 transition in Outer Western Carpathians. Similarly, documented events of MIS 3 landslide activity from Outer Western Carpathians are rather rare. The Late Glacial to Holocene record from the younger near-scarp depression revealed vegetation and landscape changes during the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. The evidenced oldest parts of the landslide at the Maleník Ridge had to originate during more humid interpleniglacial conditions. The geomorphological evidence for landslide activity from this period has almost completely disappeared from the ground surface topography due to intensive periglacial processes operating later during the Last Glacial Maximum and subsequent fluvial and anthropogenic processes of the Holocene. The cold and relatively dry period of the pleniglacial is considered as a time when deep-seated mass movements use to be halted and overprinted by shallow solifluction of the active layer masking former deep-seated landslide features.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a new concept of geological control of the Outer Western Carpathians (OWC) morphology. The establishment of the Carpathians' morphology dates back to the stage of evolution of sedimentary basin, when huge blocks of solidified rock massifs were gravitationally displaced into the foreland sedimentary basins, forming finally isolated hills. The altitudinal difference between the Beskidy Mts. and the Carpathian foothills is caused by the structural positions of these two segments of rock massifs within the orogenic megastructure during the compressional stage. Indeed, the tectonic elements that formed during the earliest stage of compression took (and still take) the highest structural and altitudinal position, whereas the elements incorporated into the orogen as the last have taken a lower topographic position, forming a belt of foothills. Therefore, this difference in topography is not related to rock resistance only, as was previously thought. The rotation of the Carpathian blocks during the orogenic thrusting and the formation of strike-slip fault zones parallel to the Carpathian tectonic thrusts formed a flower structure, which has played a significant role in morphology (insular character of). During the stage of secondary tectonic deformation – including the rotation of the Carpathian tectonic segments, strike-slip faulting and the radial extension and large extensional collapse of the Carpathian massifs – the principal features of the Carpathian relief as well as the main river valleys were formed. Gravitational collapse resulted in back-thrusting and the tectonic exhumation of the Carpathian massifs, which helps to explain the problem of seemingly large denudation of the Carpathian overburden of a thickness estimated at several kilometres. Chaotic complexes (synsedimentary and syntectonic mélanges), which frequently occur in the Carpathians, are very important for the Carpathian morphology and river valley development (controlled not only by faults) as well as the formation of isolated hills. Analysis of the Carpathian morphology supported by the Bouguer's gravity anomalies map, and geological data allow us to present a new hypothesis that the Carpathians were formed as a huge regional flower structure, without the participation of subduction, which has formerly been considered to play the crucial role in the formation of the Carpathian orogen.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive database of larger Rock Slope Failures (RSFs) has been compiled and characterised for a whole mountain range, possibly for the first time apart from Iceland. Most RSFs in the Scottish Highlands occurred soon after deglaciation. A threshold size of 0.25 km2 focuses on RSFs which contribute significantly to gross erosion in the glacial–paraglacial cycle, and on the spatial concentration of this poorly recognised process. Database verification indicates that at least 90\% of the total extant population in the Highlands is covered. Standard mass movement typologies are broadly applicable, but require some refinement to characterise RSFs in a passive-margin glaciated mountain range comprised mainly of ancient metasediments. Most larger RSFs here are complex and difficult to categorise. A continuum from dcataclasmicT failures (including rock avalanches) through arrested translational slides to almost in situ slope deformations is identified. The prevailing modes of large RSF are arrested (short-travel) translational sliding and gravitational sagging. Cataclasmic failure is rare, and sub-cataclasmic outcomes are more evident. A significant class of deformations exhibits compressional rather than extensional features, and may be responding to localised glacio-isostatic rebound stresses. The large RSF population is widely but very unevenly distributed across the main mountain areas: 65\% are in seven main clusters, with the rest non-randomly scattered. Previous glaciological, lithological, and seismotectonic explanations are insufficient to explain this spatial pattern, and overlook the basic engineering geology prerequisites for failure. Massifs of similar relief and lithology can display intense or sparse RSF incidence. Geomorphological appraisal suggests an association with recently active glacial breaches of main and secondary watersheds, with RSF being scarce or absent in valleys inherited from Tertiary uplift, and in mountain groups away from the main watersheds. Valleys which adapted early to ice discharge are seen as dstress-hardenedT, with their slopes unlikely to reach critical thresholds for failure after subsequent reoccupations by ice. Concentrated erosion in the last glaciations is most likely to be found close to where breaches are actively forming or enlarging. Such erosion in the slope foot and valley floor may have daylighted failure planes or generated rebound stresses augmenting those from other endemic sources sufficiently to provoke widespread paraglacial RSF. Slope stress models for deglaciated valleys and comparative studies in other glaciated mountain ranges are required to test this concept, and may assist in geohazard assessments.},

  abstract = {This first overview of large-scale rock slope failure (RSF) in the Pyrenees addresses the eastern third of the range. Around 30 principal RSFs greater than 0.25 km2 and 20 lesser or uncertain cases have been identified from remote imagery and groundtruthing. Compared with other European mountain ranges, RSF incidence is relatively sparse, displays no obvious regional trend or spatial clustering, and occurs across diverse landscape types, if mainly on metamorphic rocks. A transition is observed from paraglacial RSFs in formerly glaciated valleys to what are here termed ‘parafluvial’ RSFs, within wholly or mainly fluvial valleys but where slope failure is not directly provoked by or linked to river erosion. RSFs are particularly found in three topographic settings: at cirque and trough-head thresholds (transition zones of elevated instability between cirque and main glaciated trough walls); near the upper or outer periphery of the ice field, where glacial adaptation of fluvial valleys is incomplete; and in fluvial valleys beyond glacial limits where incision is locally intense. RSF is absent from the range divide, from within cirques, and from most main valleys. In the montane areas, RSF is strongly associated with vestiges of preglacial summit surfaces, confirming that plateau ridges are less stable than sharpened crests and horns. RSF is contributing significantly to the progressive destruction of this paleic relief. The overall sparsity of RSF indicates insufficient rock mass stresses, including rebound after concentrated bedrock erosion. This may reflect a relatively weak imprint of glacial erosion, including breaching, in a context of relatively low mean rates of neotectonic uplift, possibly signalling overall that eastern Pyrenees landscapes are close to dynamic equilibrium.},

Dense RSF clusters exist in Scotland and Norway, but overall RSF distribution in Scandinavia is poorly known. In the Abisko area, air photo scrutiny confirms the reported incidence of sparse but significant RSF. In the Kärkevagge complex, the Rissa RSF is one of the largest in northern Europe, with a scar volume of 42 Mm3. The well-known Giant Boulder Deposit (GBD) is a rock avalanche emanating from the Rissa RSF scar, the interpretation of wholesale valley wall retreat at deglaciation being discounted. In the adjacent valley of Vassivagge, a major RSF on Vuoitasrita has a similar area and morpholocation, but lacks a GBD. It has consumed 5–10\% of the relict preglacial mountain surface. Both RSFs are near incipient watershed breaches in valleys which may have undergone vigorous enlargement during the last stadial. Glaciation history may explain spatial incidence as well as neotectonic and other triggers. The localised geomorphic impact of RSF in the Abisko mountains is high by comparison with contemporary slope processes. The cumulative impact of paraglacial RSF over the Quaternary may have been considerable, and RSF may be an indicator of concentrated late-stage glacial erosion.},

  abstract = {Landslide susceptibility, hazards, and risks have been extensively explored and analyzed in the past decades. However, choosing relevant conditioning factors in such analyses remains a challenging task. Landslide susceptibility mapping employs topological, environmental, geological, and hydrological parameters. Some researchers assume that as the number of conditioning factors increases, the precision of the generated susceptibility map increases. By contrast, other case studies prove that a small number of conditioning factors are sufficient to produce landslide susceptibility maps with a reasonable quality. This study investigates the effects of conditioning factors on landslide susceptibility mapping. Bukit Antarabangsa, Ulu Klang, Malaysia was selected as the study area, because it is a catchment area with a high potential of landslide occurrence. A spatial database of 31 landslide locations was evaluated to map landslide-susceptible areas. Two datasets of conditioning factors were constructed in GIS environment. The first dataset was derived from high-resolution airborne laser scanning data (LiDAR), which contains eight landslide conditioning factors: altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic roughness index (TRI), and sediment transport index (STI). The second dataset was gathered by using the same conditioning factors of the first dataset, but with the addition of other conditioning factors: geological and environmental factors of soil, geology, land use/cover (LULC), distance from river, and distance from road. Two different datasets were constructed to compare the efficiency of one over the other in landslide susceptibility zonation. Three methods were implemented to recognize the importance of different conditioning factors in landslide susceptibility mapping. Three different types of models such as weights-of-evidence (WoE) (bivariate statistical analysis), logistic regression (LR) (multivariate statistical analysis), and data-driven support vector machine (SVM) were used to determine the optimal landslide conditioning factors. The area under curve (AUC) was used to assess the obtained results. The prediction rates of WoE, LR, and SVM obtained from only the LiDAR-derived conditioning factors were 59\%, 86\%, and 84\%, respectively. The prediction rates of the WoE, LR, and SVM obtained from the second dataset were 65\%, 66\%, and 69\%, respectively. The LiDAR-derived conditioning factors were more sufficient in generating an accurate landslide susceptibility map. Using additional factors, such as geology, LULC, and so on, does not significantly increase the accuracy of the map. The findings of this study can be used as reference for future analysis in selecting data for landslide conditioning factors.},

  abstract = {The aims of this review are to: (a) describe and interpret structures in valley glaciers in relation to strain history; and (b) to explore how these structures inform our understanding of the kinematics of large ice masses, and a wide range of other aspects of glaciology. Structures in glaciers give insight as to how ice deforms at the macroscopic and larger scale. Structures also provide information concerning the deformation history of ice masses over centuries and millennia. From a geological perspective, glaciers can be considered to be models of rock deformation, but with rates of change that are measurable on a human time-scale. However, structural assemblages in glaciers are commonly complex, and unraveling them to determine the deformation history is challenging; it thus requires the approach of the structural geologist. A wide range of structures are present in valley glaciers: (a) primary structures include sedimentary stratification and various veins; (b) secondary structures that are the result of brittle and ductile deformation include crevasses, faults, crevasse traces, foliation, folds, and boudinage structures. Some of these structures, notably crevasses, relate well to measured strain-rates, but to explain ductile structures analysis of cumulative strain is required. Some structures occur in all glaciers irrespective of size, and they are therefore recognizable in ice streams and ice shelves. Structural approaches have wide (but as yet under-developed potential) application to other sub-disciplines of glaciology, notably glacier hydrology, debris entrainment and transfer, landform development, microbiological investigations, and in the interpretation of glacier-like features on Mars.},

The pattern of landsliding was unusual: the number and concentration of triggered slides was much less than expected for an earthquake of this magnitude, and the landslides were concentrated in a narrow zone about 30-km wide that straddled the fault-rupture zone over its entire 300-km length. Despite the overall sparse landslide concentration, the earthquake triggered several large rock avalanches that clustered along the western third of the rupture zone where acceleration levels and ground-shaking frequencies are thought to have been the highest. Inferences about near-field strong-shaking characteristics drawn from interpretation of the landslide distribution are strikingly consistent with results of recent inversion modeling that indicate that high-frequency energy generation was greatest in the western part of the fault-rupture zone and decreased markedly to the east.

If evidence indicates that a seismic origin is likely for a landslide or group of landslides, and if the landslides can be dated, then a paleo-eanhquake can be inferred, and some of its characteristics can be estimated. St'\textasciitilde h paleoseismic landslide studies thus can help reconstruct the seismic history of a site or region. In regions that contain multiple seismic sources and in regions where surface faulting is absent, paleoseismic ground-failure studies are valuable tools in hazard and risk studies that are more concerned with shaking hazards than with interpretation of the movement histories of individual faults. Paleoseismic landslide analysis involves three steps: (1) identifying a feature as a landslide, (2) dating the landslide, and (3) showing that the landslide was triggered by earthquake shaking.

  abstract = {The purpose of this review paper is to present the techniques, advances, problems and likely future developments in numerical modelling for rock mechanics. Such modelling is essential for studying the fundamental processes occurring in rocks and for rock engineering design. The review begins by explaining the special nature of rock masses and the consequential difficulties when attempting to model their inherent characteristics of discontinuousness, anisotropy, inhomogeneity and inelasticity. The rock engineering design backdrop to the review is also presented. The different types of numerical models are outlined in Section 2, together with a discussion on how to obtain the necessary parameters for the models. There is also discussion on the value that is obtained from the modelling, especially the enhanced understanding of those mechanisms initiated by engineering perturbations. In Section 3, the largest section, states-of-the-art and advances associated with the main methods are presented in detail. In many cases, for the model to adequately represent the rock reality, it is necessary to incorporate couplings between the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes. The physical processes and the equations characterizing the coupled behaviour are included in Section 4, with an illustrative example and discussion on the likely future development of coupled models. Finally, in Section 5, the advances and outstanding issues in the subject are listed and in Section 6 there are specific recommendations concerning quality control, enhancing confidence in the models, and the potential future developments.},

Stress fatigue and a combination of rain and snow followed by rapid melt and night-time freezing could have co-triggered the slide.

  abstract = {Geomorphic mapping in the upper Conejos River Valley of the San Juan Mountains has shown that three distinct periods of aggradation have occurred since the end of the last glacial maximum (LGM). The first occurred during the Pleistocene–Holocene transition (\textasciitilde{} 12.5–9.5 ka) and is interpreted as paraglacial landscape response to deglaciation after the LGM. Evidence of the second period of aggradation is limited but indicates a small pulse of sedimentation at \textasciitilde{} 5.5 ka. A third, more broadly identifiable period of sedimentation occurred in the late Holocene (\textasciitilde{} 2.2–1 ka). The latest two periods of aggradation are concurrent with increases in the frequency of climate change in the region suggesting that Holocene alpine and sub-alpine landscapes respond more to rapid changes in climate than to large singular climatic swings. Soil development and radiocarbon dating indicate that hillslopes were stable during the Holocene even while aggradation was occurring in valley bottoms. Thus, we can conclude that erosion does not occur equally throughout the landscape but is focused upslope of headwater streams, along tributary channels, or on ridge tops. This is in contrast to some models which assume equal erosion in headwater basins.},

  abstract = {Some recent paleoseismic studies have focused on dating ridge-top graben deposits to evaluate the timing of paleoseismic events. By contrast, our study of the Santiago landslide demonstrates that ridge-top grabens also can be associated with aseismic, deep-seated landsliding. The Santiago landslide in Anaheim Hills, California, failed during the winter of 1992–1993 in response to elevated groundwater conditions associated with intense rainfall. The head of the active landslide included a zone of extensional deformation along the bounding ridgeline. Interpretation of historical, aerial photographs indicates that the active landslide is a re-activated, ancient, deep-seated, translational landslide and an associated ridge-top graben. Large-diameter borings within the ridge-top graben encountered thick colluvium, steeply dipping colluvium-filled fractures, and shears with normal offsets. In contrast to the rupture surface within the central part of the landslide, the basal rupture surfaces in the graben area had significantly less gouge. We interpret this contrast in gouge development as an indication that the ridge-top graben developed later than the original landslide by upslope progression of the deformation. Our limit-equilibrium, slope-stability analyses indicate that either high groundwater or seismic ground motion could have previously activated the ancient landslide and ridge-top graben. Because colluvial deposits preserved within the ridge-top graben and produced by these two different types of triggering events could be misinterpreted as representing the late Quaternary paleoseismic record, these features are not useful for paleoseismic studies unless aseismic activation can be clearly precluded.},

Various factors are discussed including: reflection profiling, velocity soundings, test surveys, topography, logistics, data quality and extreme environments. Basic data processing and visualization are then reviewed, followed by a discussion on GPR interpretation strategies including a background to radar stratigraphy.

  abstract = {The western part of the Argentera–Mercantour massif (French Alps) hosts very large currently active landslides responsible of many disorders and risks to the highly touristic valleys of the Mercantour National Park and skiing resorts. A regional scale mapping of gravitational deformations has been compared to the main geo-structures of the massif. A relative chronology of the events has been established and locally compared to absolute 10Be dating obtained from previous studies. Two types of large slope destabilisations were identified as follows: deep-seated landslides (DSL) that correspond to rock volumes bounded by a failure surface, and deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSD) defined as large sagging zones including gravitation landforms such as trenches and scarps or counterscarps. Gravitational landforms are mainly collinear to major N140°E and N020°E tectonic faults, and the most developed DSGSD are located in areas where the slope direction is comparable to the orientation of faults. DSL are mostly included within DSGSD zones and located at the slopes foot. Most of DSL followed a similar failure evolution process according to postglacial over steepened topographies and resulting from a progressive failure growing from the foot to the top of the DSGSD that lasts over a 10ky time period. This massif-scale approach shows that large-scale DSGSD had a peak of activity from the end of the last deglaciation, to approximately 7000years BP. Both morphologic and tectonic controls can be invoked to explain the gravitational behaviour of the massif slopes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a smoothing method that eliminates valleys of various Strahler-order drainage lines from a digital elevation model (DEM), thus enabling the recovery of local and regional trends in a terrain. A novel method for automated extraction of high-density channel network is developed to identify ridgelines defined as the watershed boundaries of channel segments. A DEM using TIN interpolation is calculated based on elevations of digitally extracted ridgelines. This removes first-order watersheds from the DEM. Higher levels of DEM smoothing can be achieved by the application of the method to ridgelines of higher-order channels. The advantage of the proposed smoothing method over traditional smoothing methods of moving kernel, trend and spectral methods is that it does not require pre-definition of smoothing parameters, such as kernel or trend parameters, and thus it follows topography in an adaptive way. Another advantage is that smoothing is controlled by the physical-hydrological properties of the terrain, as opposed to mathematical filters. Level of smoothing depends on ridgeline geometry and density, and the applied user-defined channel order. The method requires digital extraction of a high-density channel and ridgeline network. The advantage of the smoothing method over traditional methods is demonstrated through a case study of the Kali Basin test site in Hungary. The smoothing method is used in this study for aspect generalisation for morphotectonic investigations in a small watershed.},

  abstract = {Tectonic movement along faults is often reflected by characteristic geomorphological features such as linear valleys, ridgelines and slope-breaks, steep slopes of uniform aspect, regional anisotropy and tilt of terrain. Analysis of digital elevation models, by means of numerical geomorphology, provides a means of recognizing fractures and characterizing the tectonics of an area in a quantitative way. The objective of this study is to investigate the use of numerical geomorphometric methods for tectonic geomorphology through a case study. The methodology is based on general geomorphometry. In this study, the basic geometric attributes (elevation, slope, aspect and curvatures) are complemented with the automatic extraction of ridge and valley lines and surface specific points. Evans’ univariate and bivariate methodology of general geomorphometry is extended with texture (spatial) analysis methods, such as trend, autocorrelation, spectral, and network analysis. Terrain modelling is implemented with the integrated use of: (1) numerical differential geometry; (2) digital drainage network analysis; (3) digital image processing; and (4) statistical and geostatistical analysis. Application of digital drainage network analysis is emphasized. A simple shear model with principal displacement zone with an NE–SW orientation can account for most of the the morphotectonic features found in the basin by geological and digital tectonic geomorphology analyses.

  abstract = {As one of the main environmental effects of earthquakes, the distribution of landslides could reflect regional neotectonic activity. To that end, we carried out an inventory of landslides along the Precordillera range (31°-33°S) comprising the most seismically active region of Argentina. Main Quaternary deformation is concentrated in this Western central part of the country associated with active faults linked to intense shallow seismic activity ({$<$} 35 km depth). During the last 150 years, the region has suffered at least six major earthquakes with a magnitude greater than Ms ≥ 7.0. The main focus of this research is to analyse the distribution of landslides along this Andean active orogenic front and characterize the response of collapses. We analysed morphological parameters of these landslides. According to our results, collapses match with traces of active Quaternary faults in this region. Landslides are clustered however, being more densely splayed in the centre of the study area and decreasing gradually towards the North and the South. We propose that the Juan Fernandez Ridge trace promotes a higher rate of deformation in this area, matching with higher historical seismicity and distribution of landslides.},

  abstract = {The paper presents the complex geological structure and microstructure of four selected polydeformed shear zones within the granitoid core of the High Tatra Mountains. Sequences of deformation and mineralization were determined for each zone. In order to determine the deformation conditions, petrotectonic analysis and the chlorite geothermometer were applied. The obtained data were correlated with earlier published fluid inclusions investigations. Next, the results were supported by petrotectonic and structural analyses, and on the basis of the whole set of data three groups of structures were distinguished: 1  pre-Alpine (connected with late Variscan extension or Early Jurassic rifting, brittle-plastic in character); 2  Alpine (formed during the Late Cretaceous thrusting, marked by the presence of flat-dipping slickensided faults); 3  late Tertiary (linked with the uplift of the Tatra massif and the accompanying extension and sinistral oblique-normal-slip faults). On the basis of the pressure 1.451.70 kba (145170 MPa) and temperatures (212254 °C) estimated from fluid inclusion analysis, as well as temperatures range of 205250 °C obtained from the Cathelineau geothermometer, the depth of the granitoid massif position during the Late Cretaceous Alpine thrust folding was determined at 67 km and the geothermal gradient at ca. 30 °C.},

This approach may be particularly useful in the mountainous areas of Central Europe, where slopes are mantled by layers of cover materials of complex gen- esis and predominantly Pleistocene age (cover beds). This study uses results obtained in two areas typified by the middle mountains landscape type, located in different parts of the Carpathians but sharing a similar pattern of slope geology, with sandstones dominating the upper slope sections and shales underlying the lower parts. The differences in soil morphology as well as physical and chemical properties allow two main layers within the soil material to be distinguished – the upper layer and lower (basal) layer, separated by a lithologic discontiuity. This is confirmed by the analysis of the mineral composition of the upper layer of soil material, which shows significant uniformity along the slope despite the large variety in types of flysch bedrock. The data indicate that cover deposits (cover beds) – transported and transformed by geomorphic processes, with apparent aeolian admixture – constitute the solum parent material of soils occupying most of the investigated slopes. The properties of these deposits, particularly texture and mineral composition, are to a large extent controlled by the properties of sandstones even though they only found in the upper- most parts of the investigated slopes.},

The slopes generally have been stable in the last 200 years or so, covered by historical records. In this paper we use the presence of periglacial solifluction layers (cover-beds) and soil characteristics as indicators of the status of hillslopes and relative age of landslides. We follow an assumption that if landslides predate the Holocene, then solifluction layers should be present and soils within and outside landslide-affected slopes should have similar characteristics, allowing for differences caused by local factors. Cover-beds are not expected to be associated with Holocene landslides. Differences in the degree of soil development may be used to argue for different ages of some landslides within the Holocene. The absence of solifluction layers cannot always be regarded as the evidence of postPleistocene landsliding since such a layer is unlikely to have ever formed on densely jointed, but otherwise strong, rhyolite. Soil morphological properties, particularly horizonation, helped to establish the relative chronology of mass movement and to recognize both early to mid-Holocene and late Holocene landslides. Soils are good relative-dating tools and their usage does not necessarily require adherence to any particular soil classification system. This is because morphological features of entire profiles provide more information than diagnostic properties used in these systems.},

Although use of a uniform scale is desirable, it is not always possible because of changes in instrumentation, the data reduction method and the magnitude formula, the station distribution, etc. As a result, various magnitude scales have been developed and are currently in use. Recent developments in seismometry and earthquake source theories provide more quantitative source parameters than the magnitude. In order to maintain continuity and uniformity of the data, it is important to relate these magnitude scales and the new parameters. In view of this importance, relations between different magnitude scales are examined with an emphasis on the difference in the period of the waves used for the magnitude determination. Use of several magnitude scales determined at different periods provides a convenient method for characterizing earthquakes. The moment magnitude can be used to quantify both shallow and deep earthquakes on the basis of wave energy radiated, and provides a uniform scheme.},

  abstract = {A progressive entrainment model has been incorporated into an energy-based runout model to calculate the kinematic characteristics of debris flow. The progressive entrainment model considers both rolling and sliding motions of erodible material. To study the effect of the controlling parameters in the entrainment model, sensitivity analyses have been carried out by varying model parameters such as the internal friction angle of the debris, the basal friction angle of the channel, the turbulent flow coefficient, and the mean value of the probabilistic density function (PDF) for the resting angle. The results are evaluated by calculating the change of the maximum entrainment rate, the maximum frontal velocity, the final total volume, the longitudinal length of deposition, the maximum debris flow height, and the runout distance of the debris. The progressive entrainment runout model is sensitive to the characteristic particle size, basal friction angle and turbulent coefficient. Measurements from the 1990 Tsingshan debris flow, Hong Kong, China, are used to validate the model. Velocities at different channel sections estimated using the super-elevation method and entrainment depth are used to evaluate the simulation results. Comparing the results between simulated and observed maximum velocity and entrainment depth indicate that the progressive entrainment model together with the runout model can capture the erosion characteristics of the granular material. The results are also compared with that using a dynamic entrainment model. The results demonstrate that the progressive entrainment model provides a more realistic calculation of entrainment for this case compared with the dynamic entrainment model.},

Cenozoic glaciation in the southern hemisphere. Annual Reviews of Earth and Planetary Science 11, 99–132.]), occurred at 1.1~Ma and subsequent glaciations were overall less extensive. The GPG preceded global minimum temperatures and maximal volume of ice, which occurred in the last \textasciitilde 800~kyr, as recorded in the marine δ18O record. Significant modification of the drainage morphology of the southern Andes from a non-glaciated to glaciated landscape occurred throughout the Quaternary Period. We infer a non-climatic relationship between glacial modification of the mountains and the decreasing extent of ice and we discuss processes of landscape development that could have caused the trend. Specifically, these include modification of valleys, such as development from a V- to a U-shape, and lowering of mass-accumulation areas. Such changes would strongly affect glacial dynamics, the mass balance profile and mass-flux during succeeding glaciations, especially for low-gradient outlet glaciers occupying low areas. Other areas around Earth (at least where ice has been warm-based) also may exhibit a non-random trend of decreasing extent of ice with time, ultimately because of glacial erosion in the Quaternary Period.},

  abstract = {Wallachian (shepherd) colonisation of the upper parts of the Carpathians, the second largest mountain range in Europe, provides a unique opportunity to study human‐induced ecological changes and subsequent sediment mobilisation within slope and fluvial systems. The Wallachians came to the nearly pristine landscape in the Czech part of the Western Carpathians during the 16th to 17th century bringing large‐scale deforestation and grazing to the upper parts of its ridges. Despite the importance of this event, there is a lack of high‐resolution multiproxy reconstructions to help decipher the relative influence of anthropogenic and climate factors on this landscape. Here, we provide an approximately 2.1‐kyr record obtained from a peat bog where, using chronological, sedimentological, and pollen analyses, we were able to differentiate between environmental conditions before, during, and after colonisation. Prior to colonisation, climate deterioration following the onset of Little Ice Age caused changes in forest composition and erosion events (causing a \textasciitilde AD 0–1500 gap in the record). Abrupt human‐induced deforestation detected in the pollen record, together with the abundant fine‐grained minerogenic content of peat deposits between AD \textasciitilde 1640 and AD 1870, corresponds to increased run‐off and sheet erosion on slopes, enhanced by Little Ice Age climate deterioration. The sedimentary record in alluvial deposits downstream indicates that the colonisation of the mountain slopes in this region not only had a local effect on soil degradation, but it also increased the net aggradation of overbank deposits within valley floors. After reforestation, net aggradation was replaced by river incision into alluvia.},

However, recent studies in other areas of the Northern Japanese Alps have interpreted similar landforms as characteristic landslide bodies. We re-examined the origin and age of moraine-like landforms on the eastern side of Mount Shiroumadake through field geological surveys and landform analysis. We show that terminal moraine-like landforms in our study area consist of beds of brecciated or crushed gravel with locally derived crackle clasts and are unrepresentative of the variety of bedrock expose in the plausible source areas of Pleistocene glaciers. We interpret these deposits as induced by mass rock creep and landsliding at the terminus of a steep ridge or a steep valley side slope. Similarly, terrace surfaces formerly-interpreted as of outwash or fluvial origin consist of gravel beds with many fractured rock clasts of landslide origin. Although the timing of the landslides is not well constrained, they may have occurred in the early to middle Holocene. The highly deformed rocks of the study area, combined with the humid climate with much snowfall and rainfall, have left the landscape with an inherent predisposition for landsliding. Paleoearthquakes on nearby active faults in the piedmont area of Mount Shiroumadake may have provided a direct trigger for landsliding.},

  abstract = {In steep and rocky terrains, their rough surfaces make it difficult to create landslide inventories even with detailed maps/images produced from airborne LiDAR data. To provide objective clues in locating deep-seated landslides, the surface textures of a 5 km2 steepland area in Japan was investigated using the eigenvalue ratio and slope filters calculated from a very high resolution LiDAR-derived DEM. The range of filter values was determined for each of a number of surface features mapped in the field and these included: cracked bedrock outcrops, coarse colluvial deposits, gently undulating surfaces, and smooth surfaces. Recently active slides commonly contained patches of ground in which deposition and erosion occurred together near the erosion front, or where cracked bedrock outcrops and coarse colluvial deposits coexisted under a gently undulating surface. The characteristic eigenvalue and slope filter values representing this sliding process were applied to maps of the DEM derived filter values to extract potential sites of recent landslide activity. In addition, the relationships between the filter values of deep-seated landslides at various stages of evolution within the field mapped area were extended to the entire study area, to assess the contribution that landslide evolution makes to change in the landscape as a whole. While landslide components made up the steepest as well as the gentlest parts of the landscape depending on their evolutionary stage, landslides were constantly coarsened and steepened by progressive erosion, probably initiated by river bank erosion at the foot of slopes.},

This sample of 40 events was supplemented with intensity data from several hundred United States earthquakes to study relations between landslide distribution and seismic parameters. Fourteen types of landslides were identified in the earthquakes studied. The most abundant of these were rock falls, disrupted soil slides, and rock slides. The greatest losses of human life were due to rock avalanches, rapid soil flows, and rock falls. Correlations between magnitude (M) and landslide distribution show that the maximum area likely to be affected by landslides in a seismic event increases from approximately 0 at M = 4.0 to 500,000 km2 at M = 9.2.},

  abstract = {Post-earthquake field investigations of landslide occurrence have provided a basis for understanding, evaluating, and mapping the hazard and risk associated withearthquake-induced landslides. This paper traces thehistorical development of knowledge derived from these investigations. Before 1783, historical accounts of the occurrence of landslides in earthquakes are typically so incomplete and vague that conclusions based on these accounts are of limited usefulness. For example, the number of landslides triggered by a given event is almost always greatly underestimated. The first formal, scientific post-earthquake investigation that included systematic documentation of the landslides was undertaken in the Calabria region of Italy after the 1783 earthquake swarm. From then until the mid-twentieth century, the best information on earthquake-induced landslides came from a succession ofpost-earthquake investigations largely carried out by formal commissions that undertook extensive ground-based field studies. Beginning in the mid-twentieth century, when the use of aerial photography became widespread, comprehensive inventories of landslide occurrence have been made for several earthquakes in the United States, Peru, Guatemala, Italy, El Salvador, Japan, and Taiwan. Techniques have also been developed for performing ``retrospective'' analyses years or decades after an earthquake that attempt to reconstruct the distribution of landslides triggered by the event. The additional use of Geographic Information System (GIS) processing and digital mapping since about 1989 has greatly facilitated the level of analysis that can applied to mapped distributions of landslides. Beginning in 1984, syntheses of worldwide and national data on earthquake-induced landslides have defined their general characteristics and relations between their occurrence and various geologic and seismic parameters. However, the number of comprehensive post-earthquake studies of landslides is still relatively small, and one of the most pressing needs in this area of research is for the complete documentation of landslides triggered by many more earthquakes in a wider variety of environments.},

  abstract = {This study indicates the possible long-lasting impacts of deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DGSD) on erosional and mass movement processes. DGSD-features are common large-scale landforms in the crystalline basement rocks of the Central Alps of Austria. Inactive forms are related to paraglacial (nonglacial processes directly conditioned by former glaciation and deglaciation) rock slope adjustment processes acting after glacier retreat towards the end of the Late Glacial period. The near-surface metamorphic bedrock of DGSD-features is generally disintegrated. Such rock type favours erosion and the formation of small landslides. Field data, laboratory analyses, aerial photographs, and GIS-based terrain analyses are used to describe the different geomorphic effects of an extremely disintegrated rock slope. The studied DGSD Hauser Kaibling (13.6 km2) is located in central Austria. During the Last Glacial Maximum the adjacent valley glacier reached an altitude of approximately 1900 m a.s.l. Glacier retreat in combination with the unfavourable tectono-metamorphic setting caused gravity-induced stresses to act. Subsequent sediment build-up in the main valley restabilised the slope. Linear erosion cut a number of gullies into the lower part of the DGSD. Calculated mean erosional denudation rates at incised valley sections range from 0.5 to 2.6 mm a−1 since deglaciation. Smaller active landslides on the sides of the steep gullies draining the DGSD contribute to high denudation rates. Active landsliding is favoured by: (i) fragmented rock, (ii) steep slopes, (iii) supply of surface and subsurface water by rain and snowmelt, and (iv) human impact. Debris flows and debris-charged flood events occurred frequently in the past. During such events, material was transported from the unstable slopes to the populated alluvial fans. Thus, knowledge about the spatial distribution and the stage of development of DGSDs (active and currently inactive) provides an important basis for risk management measures.},

In particular a model is developed for the timedependent degradation of rock joint cohesion. Degradation of joint cohesion is modeled as the time-dependent breaking of intact patches or rock bridges along the joint surface. A fracture mechanics model is developed utilizing subcritical crack growth, which results in a closed-form solution for joint cohesion as a function of time. As an example, a rock block containing rock bridges subjected to plane sliding is analyzed. The cohesion is found to continually decrease, at first slowly and then more rapidly. At a particular value of time the cohesion reduces to value that results in slope instability. A second example is given where variations in some of the material parameters are assumed. A probabilistic slope analysis is conducted, and the probability of failure as a function of time is predicted. The probability of failure is found to increase with time, from an initial value of 5\% to a value at 100 years of over 40\%. These examples show the importance of being able to predict the timedependent behavior of a rock mass containing discontinuities, even for relatively short-term rock structures.},

They have minimum volumes of f 106 – 107 m3 and, normally preceded by prolonged intervals of accelerating creep, are produced by catastrophic and deepseated slope collapse (loads f 1 – 10 MPa). Conventional analyses attribute rapid collapse to unusual mechanisms, such as the vaporization of ground water during sliding. Here, catastrophic collapse is related to self-accelerating rock fracture, common in crustal rocks at loads f 1 – 10 MPa and readily catalysed by circulating fluids. Fracturing produces an abrupt drop in resisting stress. Measured stress drops in crustal rock account for minimum sturzstrom volumes and rapid collapse accelerations. Fracturing also provides a physical basis for quantitatively forecasting catastrophic slope failure.},

  abstract = {Damage zones show very similar geometries across a wide range of scales and fault types, including strike-slip, normal and thrust faults. We use a geometric classification of damage zones into tip-, wall-, and linking-damage zones, based on their location around faults. These classes can be subdivided in terms of fault and fracture patterns within the damage zone. A variety of damage zone structures can occur at mode II tips of strike-slip faults, including wing cracks, horsetail fractures, antithetic faults, and synthetic branch faults. Wall damage zones result from the propagation of mode II and mode III fault tips through a rock, or from damage associated with the increase in slip on a fault. Wall damage zone structures include extension fractures, antithetic faults, synthetic faults, and rotated blocks with associated triangular openings. The damage formed at the mode III tips of strike-slip faults (e.g. observed in cliff sections) are classified as wall damage zones, because the damage zone structures are distributed along a fault trace in map view. Mixed-mode tips are likely to show characteristics of both mode II and mode III tips. Linking damage zones are developed at steps between two sub-parallel faults, and the structures developed depend on whether the step is extensional or contractional. Extension fractures and pull-aparts typically develop in extensional steps, whilst solution seams, antithetic faults and synthetic faults commonly develop in contractional steps. Rotated blocks, isolated lenses or strike-slip duplexes may occur in both extensional and contractional steps.},

Spatial correlations between stress concentrations and these sackungen landforms are investigated for the mean ridge forms. Rock mass properties for the modelled ridges are developed using the Hoek–Brown criterion and the Geological Strength Index (GSI). Gravity loading and combined gravity–tectonic loading on the ridge forms are considered. The importance of representing in situ rock masses with an elastoplastic (as opposed to elastic) constitutive criterion is discussed. The resulting stress distributions for the three general ridge classes indicate that different processes are responsible for the formation of sackungen landforms and slope deformations in each type of ridge.},

These comparisons can be misleading when external drivers, such as weather conditions, differ between the pre- and postremediation monitoring periods. Here, we show that remediation effectiveness may be better assessed by comparing pre- and postremediation contaminant rating curves, which permit “all else equal” comparisons of pre- and postremediation contaminant concentrations and loads under at any specified external forcing. We illustrate this approach with a remediation case study at an abandoned mercury mine in Northern California. Measured mercury loads in the stream draining the mine site were a factor of 1000 smaller after the remediation than before, superficially suggesting that the cleanup was 99.9\% effective, but rainstorms were weaker and less frequent during the postremediation monitoring period. Our analysis shows that this difference in weather conditions alone reduced mercury loads at our site by a factor of 73À85, with a further factor of 12.6À14.5 being attributable to the remediation itself, implying that the cleanup was 92À93\% (rather than 99.9\%) effective. Our results illustrate the need to account for external confounding drivers when assessing remediation efforts, particularly in systems with highly episodic forcing.},

A large statistical population of measurements obtained from moraine and rock glacier surfaces was used to analyze the variability of mean R-values in the same lithology and overall southern valley exposition. Four separate sets of glacial/periglacial morphosystems are present at different positions in the Western Tatras starting from valley outlets to the highest cirques, which represent successive phases of deglaciation. R-value means and 95\% confidence intervals for selected Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and Late Glacial (LG-1, LG-2 and LG-3) stages (respectively, 40.1 ± 1.1, 46 ± 0.5, 53.5 ± 1.0 and 60.5 ± 0.3) are significantly statistically different and values for each age category are comparable for the two analyzed valleys. The results of weathering indexes used in conjunction with geomorphological relationships were taken together to reconstruct the pattern of deglaciation on southern Tatra slopes. It is stated that the Schmidt hammer technique may be successfully used as a relative age dating tool for Late Pleistocene glacial and periglacial deposits, and with this method, it is possible to differentiate between Late Glacial moraines and rock glacier systems of different age.},

Based on the first detailed mapping of glacial landforms and sedimentological analysis, we document the presence of freshly-shaped outer moraines and glacial cirques and reconstruct the extent and ice-surface geometry of the six very small (0.09–0.78~km2 area) palaeoglaciers. The specific feature of the area is the presence of extensive mountain-top plateaus that play an important role as additional areas for snowblow accumulation. The equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) calculated from hypsometry of reconstructed local Last Glacial Maximum (LLGM) using the area x altitude balance ratio (AABR) 1.6 method is exceptionally low at 1138~m asl in the Polonyna Rivna and 1230~m asl in the Borzhava range. Excluding the topographic effect produced by additional snow accumulation the ELA shift upwards between 120 and 180~m which corresponds to 25–53\% of the glacier elevation range. The resulted climatic ELA (1282–1352~m asl) together with the mean cirque floor altitude (1194~m asl) and mean elevation of the glacier fronts (994~m asl) represent the lowest values in the entire Carpathian arc. Our data indicate glacier-friendly conditions in the mountain massifs exceeding 1400~m asl in the windward NW part of the Ukrainian Carpathians where due to relatively cold air temperatures and orographic induced precipitation local topolimatic factors dictated the development of marginal glaciation.},

  abstract = {It has long been recognised that the formerly glaciated area of Fennoscandia shows large spatial differences in thicknesses of Quaternary deposits (mainly tills), and exhibits distinct patterns of glacial scouring and deep linear erosion. The reasons for this striking zonation have been elusive, and in particular the relative roles of mountain ice sheets (MIS) and full-sized Fennoscandian ice sheets (FIS) in shaping the landscape surface need clarification. On the basis of current advances in our understanding of the climate evolution and basal thermal organisation of ice sheets, we perform spatio-temporal qualitative modelling of ice sheet extent and migration of erosion and deposition zones through the entire Quaternary, and proceed to suggest an explanatory model for the current spatial pattern of Quaternary deposits and the two different types of erosion zones. We use the spatial distribution of fjords and deep non-tectonic lakes for delineating zones of deep glacial erosion, and relict landscapes as markers for frozen-bed conditions. On the basis of the amount of exposed bedrock, the landscape was classified into a tripartite system of drift thickness (thick drift, intermediate drift thickness, absence of drift/scoured zones). It is found that a centrally placed (central and northern Sweden) zone of thick drift cannot be explained by deposition under FIS style ice sheets, but is instead likely to be the combined result of marginal deposition of fluctuating MIS style ice sheets, primarily during the early and middle Quaternary, and the inefficiency of later east-centered FIS style ice sheets in evacuating this drift from underneath their central low-velocity and possibly frozen-bed areas. The western (fjord) zone of deep glacial erosion formed underneath both MIS- and FIS style ice sheets during the entire Quaternary, while the eastern (lake) zone of deep glacial erosion is exclusively related to MIS style ice sheets, and formed largely during the early and middle Quaternary. The scouring zones formed under conditions of rapid ice flow towards bathymetrically-defined calving margins of FIS style ice sheets. They likely reflect process patterns of the last two or three FIS style ice sheets. The three landscape zones differ in their degree of permanence, with the deep erosion zones being a long-lasting legacy in the landscape, more likely to be enhanced than obliterated by subsequent glacial events. The thick drift cover zone, once established, appears to have been surprisingly robust to erosion by subsequent glacial events. The scouring zones appear to be the most recent and ephemeral of the three zones, with possible major alterations during single glacial events.},

  abstract = {In the mid-mountains of Central Europe relict forms of periglacial morphogenesis occur, including debris slope covers. However, the Holocene forest succession limited sediment transfer towards valley systems. The eastern, mid-mountain part of the Sudetes, characterised by a dense stream network and by the local occurrence of metallic and gold ores, was already settled by humans in early medieval times. Timber from the forested slopes was used to produce charcoal and streams acted as energy sources for smelting plants and smithies. Agriculture developed on less inclined slopes. Temporal clearances on steep slopes and replacement of primeval beech forest by spruce trees, influenced water circulation on slopes. The exposed slope covers were transferred to valley floors during high precipitation events. Consequently, they were selectively redeposited within the floodplain, changing the former channel pattern, especially at confluences. The introduction of cultivation on slopes triggered intense soil erosion so that agricultural terraces were built in order to prevent surface wash. The terraces are often strengthened with stone walls up to 4.5 m high. Terraces acted as ‘sediment traps’, storing the washed material within the slope. The layers of fine-grained colluvial sediments, which can be linked with agriculture, cover the older, debris slope covers. The colluvium is especially thick at the terrace edges. Despite the protective role of terracing, part of the washed material was transferred to valleys, often becoming overbank deposits, covering older gravel and boulder alluvium. The decline of iron ore exploitation and processing, at the beginning of the 19th century, together with agricultural withdrawal, which was especially radical after the 2nd World War, resulted in successive renaturalisation of the environment being followed by slope stabilisation and deepening of bigger river channels.},

The two susceptibility zonation maps were used to define landslide hazard using information about landslide reactivation and the return periods of precipitation that triggered the respective landslide types. A risk matrix was then used to qualitatively analyze the landslide risk to selected assets. The monetary value of these assets, according to actual market prices, was calculated and analyzed with respect to the risk classification. Since the study area is an important residential and recreational area, the practical application of the derived results was checked through a series of interviews conducted with personnel of the local government planning and construction office.

The main one is the absence of legally binding regulations to enforce the spatial planers to use this information.},

We focused on landslides in lateral moraines as possible triggers. Detailed geomorphological, geophysical, and satellite radar interferometric investigations of the Palcacocha Lake moraine (Cordillera Blanca, Peru) together with laboratory tests on samples from the site provided data for slope stability calculations using GeoSlope software and hydrodynamic impact wave modeling using the Iber code. We identified landslides that could affect Palcacocha Lake and calculated their stability (factor of safety) under specified conditions, including variable water saturation and earthquake effects. Calculations showed that the moraine slopes are close to the threshold value (Fs = 1) for stability and are especially sensitive to water saturation. The height of impact waves triggered by a landslide in 2003 and the potential wave heights from newly identified, possibly active landslides were calculated, based on landslide volume estimates, detailed lake bathymetry, and basin topography. Results show that potential future landslide-triggered waves could have similar properties to the 2003 impact wave. Evidence gathered in this study suggests that glacial lake outburst floods triggered by landslides from moraines, however, would be probably smaller than floods resulting from other types of slope processes (e.g., ice/rock avalanches) if dam breach is not taken into account. This assumption has to be critically evaluated against site-specific conditions at a given lake and any possible environmental factors, such as climate change or earthquake that may mobilize larger volumes of moraine material.},

In this study we used existing disaster databases (inventories) in order to examine the spatial and temporal variability of landsliding within this watershed. The spatial variability of landsliding was examined using "expert-based" and "weighted" landslide susceptibility models. The constructed landslide susceptibility maps demonstrate consistent results irrespective of the underlying method. These show that at least 55.9\% of the watershed is highly or very highly susceptible to landsliding. In addition, the temporal distribution of landsliding was analyzed and compared with climatic data. Results show that the area has a distinct bimodal rainfall distribution, and it is clear that landsliding is particularly frequent during the later rainy season between October and November. Moreover, landslides are more common during La Niña years. It is recommended that the existing landslide inventories are improved so as to be of greater use in the future land use planning of the watershed. The construction of landslide susceptibility maps based on existing data represents a significant step towards landslide mitigation in the area. Using susceptibility and hazard assessment during the developmental process should lessen the need for disaster response at a later stage.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

While the visual interpretation of LiDAR, HRDTM hillshades is a widely used approach, the automatic detection of landslides is promising to significantly speed up the compilation of inventories. Previous studies on automatic landslide detection often used a combination of optical imagery and geomorphometric data, and were implemented in commercial software. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of open source software for automated landslide detection solely based on HRDTM-derived data in a study area in Burgenland, Austria. We implemented a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) consisting of (1) the calculation of land-surface variables, textural features and shape metrics, (2) the automated optimization of segmentation scale parameters, (3) region-growing segmentation of the landscape, (4) the supervised classification of landslide parts (scarp and body) using support vector machines (SVM), and (5) an assessment of the overall classification performance using a landslide inventory. We used the free and open source data-analysis environment R and its coupled geographic information system (GIS) software for the analysis; our code is included in the Supplementary Materials. The developed approach achieved a good performance (\&kappa; = 0.42) in the identification of landslides.},

  abstract = {The abundance, activity, and temperature response of aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria were studied in permafrost-affected tundra soils of northeast Siberia. The soils were characterized by both a high accumulation of organic matter at the surface and high methane concentrations in the water-saturated soils. The methane oxidation rates of up to 835 nmol CH4 hÀ1 gÀ1 in the surface soils were similar to the highest values reported so far for natural wetland soils worldwide. The temperature response of methane oxidation was measured during short incubations and revealed maximum rates between 22  C and 28  C. The active methanotrophic community was characterized by its phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) concentrations and with stable isotope probing (SIP). Concentrations of 16:1u8 and 18:1u8 PLFAs, specific to methanotrophic bacteria, correlated significantly with the potential methane oxidation rates. In all soils, distinct 16:1 PLFAs were dominant, indicating a predominance of type I methanotrophs. However, long-term incubation of soil samples at 0  C and 22  C demonstrated a shift in the composition of the active community with rising temperatures. At 0  C, only the concentrations of 16:1 PLFAs increased and those of 18:1 PLFAs decreased, whereas the opposite was true at 22  C. Similarly, SIP with 13CH4 showed a temperature-dependent pattern. When the soils were incubated at 0  C, most of the incorporated label (83\%) was found in 16:1 PLFAs and only 2\% in 18:1 PLFAs. In soils incubated at 22  C, almost equal amounts of 13C label were incorporated into 16:1 PLFAs and 18:1 PLFAs (33\% and 36\%, respectively). We concluded that the highly active methane-oxidizing community in cold permafrostaffected soils was dominated by type I methanotrophs under in situ conditions. However, rising temperatures, as predicted for the future, seem to increase the importance of type II methanotrophs, which may affect methane cycling in northern wetlands.},

  abstract = {Climate change and high magnitude mass wasting events pose adverse societal effects and hazards, especially in alpine regions. Quantification of such geomorphic processes and their rates is therefore critical but is often hampered by the lack of appropriate techniques and the various spatiotemporal scales involved in these studies. Here we exploit both in situ cosmogenic beryllium-10 (10Be) and carbon-14 (14C) nuclide concentrations for deducing exposure ages and tracing of sediment through small alpine debris flow catchments in central Switzerland. The sediment cascade and modern processes we track from the source areas, through debris flow torrents to their final export out into sink regions with cosmogenic nuclides over an unprecedented five-year time series with seasonal resolution. Data from a seismic survey and a 90 m core revealed a glacially overdeepened basin, filled with glacial and paraglacial sediments. Surface exposure dating of fan boulders and radiocarbon ages constrain the valley fill from the last deglaciation until the Holocene and show that most of the fan existed in early Holocene times already. Current fan processes are controlled by episodic debris flow activity, snow (firn) and rock avalanches.},

  abstract = {The relationship between large deep-seated landslides and geologic structures characteristic of accretionary complexes were examined in the Chichibu belt on the eastern part of the Kii Peninsula, central Japan. In the Chichibu belt, bedrock consists of Jurassic accretionary complexes composed of basalt, limestone, chert, Permian–Triassic boundary siliceous shale (PTBS), mudstone, sandstone, and mélanges with sheared shale matrices. The landslides treated in this paper include prehistoric examples involving volumes greater than one million cubic meters (located in the Karako, Sono, Kasagi, and Aso areas), and the modern Kasugadani landslide that was triggered by the Typhoon Meari on 29–30 September 2004. The age of the landslide in the Sono area was estimated at 20,440 ± 70 BP and 20,820 ± 70 BP based on AMS-14C ages of wood fragments embedded in the dammed lake sediments, while ages of the other prehistoric slides are not known. All of the landslides occurred on dip slopes. The bedding, foliation, and fault planes of the rocks in the area generally trend E–W and dip to the north, although those in the Kasugadani area dip to the south as a result of local folding. The landslides selectively slid along the planes of (1) PTBS horizons that were less strong than those of underlying chert, (2) lithologic boundaries with physical contrasts, or (3) boundary faults between mélange units. These geologic structures, including the north-dipping bedding/cleavage/fault planes, were formed during Jurassic subduction–accretion and later uplift processes. The movement directions estimated for the 269 landslides and unstable slopes in this region are also N–NNE, and their slip planes are subparallel to the general bedding/cleavage planes in this area. Thus, future slides are also likely to occur on north-facing slopes.},

  abstract = {Earthquakes are considered to be important triggers of deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DGSD) in seismically active regions, and if that is the case, DGSD features could be candidates for off-fault paleoseismology investigations. On the basis of pit excavations and sediment cores at an off-fault DGSD site and a trench excavation across the active Neodani fault at a nearby site, we examined the records of DGSD and surface-rupturing paleoearthquakes of the Neodani fault. The four most recent DGSD events were dated at after 240 cal BP, 1710–340 cal BP, 4730–3970 cal BP, and 5570–5340 cal BP. The four most recent surface-rupturing earthquakes were dated at 1891 CE (the Nobi earthquake), 2010–1220 cal BP, 7180–2110 cal BP, and before 9540 cal BP. We conclude that the ages of the four DGSD events are consistent with surface-rupturing earthquakes on the adjacent Neodani fault. We infer that static crustal strain from repeated seismogenic faulting plays an important role in the occurrence of DGSD events, at least in the immediate vicinity of active faults, although coseismic severe shaking would have at least some effect on them. Our case study suggests that off-fault DGSDs can be used to reconstruct or refine the paleoseismic history of a nearby active fault. We propose that an ideal DGSD for that purpose would be located in an area of concentrated strain near a termination, bend, or stepover of the target fault. © 2020 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Landslide deposits dam Lake Oeschinen (Oeschinensee), located above Kandersteg, Switzerland. However, past confusion differentiating deposits of multiple landslide events has confounded efforts to quantify the volume, age, and failure dynamics of the Oeschinensee rock avalanche. Here we combine field and remote mapping, topographic reconstruction, cosmogenic surface exposure dating, and numerical runout modeling to quantify salient parameters of the event. Differences in boulder lithology and deposit morphology reveal that the landslide body damming Oeschinensee consists of debris from both an older rock avalanche, possibly Kandertal, as well as the Oeschinensee rock avalanche. We distinguish a source volume for the Oeschinensee event of 37 Mm3, resulting in an estimated deposit volume of 46 Mm3, smaller than previous estimates that included portions of the Kandertal mass. Runout modeling revealed peak and average rock avalanche velocities of 65 and 45 m/s, respectively, and support a single-event failure scenario. 36Cl surface exposure dating of deposited boulders indicates a mean age for the rock avalanche of 2.3 ± 0.2 kyr. This age coincides with the timing of a paleo-seismic event identified from lacustrine sediments in Swiss lakes, suggesting an earthquake trigger. Our results help clarify the hazard and geomorphic effects of rare, large rock avalanches in alpine settings.},

  abstract = {The importance of 10Be in different applications of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is well-known. In this context the half-life of 10Be has a crucial impact, and an accurate and precise determination of the half-life is a prerequisite for many of the applications of 10Be in cosmic-ray and earth science research. Recently, the value of the 10Be half-life has been the centre of much debate. In order to overcome uncertainties inherent in previous determinations, we introduced a new method of high accuracy and precision. An aliquot of our highly enriched 10Be master solution was serially diluted with increasing well-known masses of 9Be. We then determined the initial 10Be concentration by least square fit to the series of measurements of the resultant 10Be/9Be ratio. In order to minimize uncertainties because of mass bias which plague other low-energy mass spectrometric methods, we used for the first time Heavy-Ion Elastic Recoil Detection (HI-ERD) for the determination of the 10Be/9Be isotopic ratios, a technique which does not suffer from difficult to control mass fractionation. The specific activity of the master solution was measured by means of accurate liquid scintillation counting (LSC). The resultant combination of the 10Be concentration and activity yields a 10Be half-life of T1/2 = 1.388 ± 0.018 (1 s, 1.30\%) Ma. In a parallel but independent study (Chmeleff et al. [11]), found a value of 1.386 ± 0.016 (1.15\%) Ma. Our recommended weighted mean and mean standard error for the new value for 10Be half-life based on these two independent measurements is 1.387 ± 0.012 (0.87\%) Ma. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {This study examines the size distribution of a regional medium-scale inventory of 778 landslides in the mountainous southwest of New Zealand. The spatial density of mapped landslides per unit area can be expressed as a negative power–law function of Landslide area AL spanning three orders of magnitude (\$102–101 km2). Although observed in other studies on landslide inventories, this relationship is surprising, given the lack of absolute ages, and thus uncertainty about the temporal observation window encompassed by the data. Large slope failures (arbitrarily defined here as having a total affected area AL{$>$}1 km2) constitute 83\% of the total affected landslide area ALT. This dominance by area affects slope morphology, where large-scale landsliding reduces slope angles below the regional modal value of hillslopes, jmod\$39 . More numerous smaller and shallower failures tend to be superimposed on the pre-existing relief. Empirical scaling relationships show that large landslides involve {$>$}106 m3 of material. The volumes VL of individual preserved and presumably prehistoric (i.e. pre-1840) landslide deposits equate to 100–102 years of total sediment production from shallow landsliding in the respective catchments, and up to 103 years of contemporary regional sediment yield from the mountain ranges. Their presence in an erosional landscape indicates the geomorphic importance of landslides as temporary local sediment storage.},

  abstract = {An inventory of 846 mass movements, mainly landslides, in two alpine regions of southwest New Zealand was created to explore the geomorphic impacts of slope-failure processes on river channels and valley floors. In total, 213 (i.e. 27 per cent) of the slope failures descended to valley floors, affecting the geomorphology of trunk channels (catchment area AC {$>$} 10 km2) and valley floors in recurring patterns. A nominal classification system is introduced for characterizing (a) the physical contact nature between landslides and river channels, and (b) the resulting geomorphic consequences for drainage. Although landslide area A is useful for estimating the length of channel directly impacted by debris, it does not necessarily predict the direction of fluvial response or type of impact. Dominant persistent geomorphic imprints of bedrock landslides include channel occlusions and landslide dams in South Westland and Fiordland, respectively. Differences in size distribution and geomorphic effects on river systems between the two study regions are attributed to bedrock geology, tectonics and sediment flux. Although South Westland rivers are more frequently affected by landslides, disrupting long-term effects such as blockage are more persistent in Fiordland. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It has been proposed that hillslopes adjust to rapid uplift and bedrock incision through an increase in the rate of relief-limiting landsliding rather than gradual slope steepening. Here we test this concept by investigating the relationship between mean local relief H¯, which we take to be a proxy of long-term erosion rates E, and the occurrence of over 300 of the largest (V N 108 m3) terrestrial landslides on Earth. We find that nearly two-thirds of these giant landslides have occurred in the steepest 5\% of the Earth's land surface, where relief is close to its proposed upper strength limit. They are primarily located in deeply incised valleys, along fault-bounded fringes of active mountain belts, and in volcanic arcs.},

  abstract = {The hazard of any natural process can be expressed as a function of its magnitude and the annual probability of its occurrence in a particular region. Here we expand on the hypothesis that natural hazards have size–frequency relationships that in parts resemble inverse power laws. We illustrate that these trends apply to extremely large events, such as mega-landslides, huge volcanic debris avalanches, and outburst flows from failures of natural dams. We review quantitative evidence that supports the important contribution of extreme events to landscape development in mountains throughout the world, and propose that their common underreporting in the Quaternary record may lead to substantial underestimates of mean process rates. We find that magnitude–frequency relationships provide a link between Quaternary science and natural hazard research, with a degree of synergism and societal importance that neither discipline alone can deliver. Quaternary geomorphology, stratigraphy, and geochronology allow the reconstruction of times, magnitudes, and frequencies of extreme events, whereas natural hazard research raises public awareness of the importance of reconstructing events that have not happened historically, but have the potential to cause extreme destruction and loss of life in the future.},

Regression of channel slope versus drainage basin area objectively highlights knickpoints separating incised from aggraded reaches that often correspond to locations of large rock-slope failures. For a fixed concavity index, the highest values of the steepness index and erosion index along a given profile spatially coincide with breach channels cut into formerly riverdamming rockslide debris as old as 10 k.y. Assuming that the knickpoints do not predate slope failure, data show that high profile steepness and inferred specific stream power are not always the cause, but often a result, of large river-blocking rock-slope failure in mountain basins. Omission of rockslide data from slope-area plots lowers the steepness index and increases the concavity index on average, yet only in few cases more than one standard deviation.},

Contemporary rates of rock uplift U in the Swiss Alps show two distinctive dome-like peak regions that attain \textasciitilde 1.6 mm yr−1. We focus on the Alpenrhein catchment and its surroundings, where one of these peak regions spatially coincides with widely exposed Cretaceous Bündner schist and lower Tertiary flysch. Field assessments and analyses of hillslope gradient distributions quantitatively demonstrate the low rock-mass strength and high erodibility of these rocks. This is reflected in mean postglacial catchment erosion rates D \textasciitilde 4 mm yr−1, as opposed to 0.7 mm yr−1 in more resistant crystalline rocks. Though largely inferred from landslide- and debris-flow prone tributary catchments b 20 km2, the localised erosion rates in Bündner schist and flysch are among the highest documented for the Alps, and corroborated by historic suspended sediment yields, and thus export, from the region. We further find that the steepness of bedrock rivers, the density of large landslides, and D correlate with the highest values of U. Our observations highlight the possibility that erosion of mechanically weak Bündner schist and flysch enhanced by large landslides may have contributed to regional crustal unloading, and concomitant rock uplift. Irrespective of whether this is betraying a coupling between longterm uplift and erosion modulated by rock type, our findings indicate that long-term (103 to 104 yr) geomorphic signals contained in bedrock-river steepness, spatial density of large landslides, and postglacial erosion rates strikingly correlate with regional gradients of historic (101 yr) rock uplift rates.},

The elemental and isotopic (Sr, Nd, Pb and Li) composition of these Cenozoic basalts emplaced east of the Antarctic Peninsula is different from the compositions of the fore-arc alkaline volcanic rocks in Southern Shetlands and nearby Bransfield Strait. The variability in elemental and isotopic composition is not consistent with the JRIVG derivation from a single mantle source but rather it suggests that the magma was mainly derived from a depleted mantle with subordinate OIB-like enriched mantle component (EM II). The isotopic data are consistent with mantle melting during extension and possible roll-back of the subducted lithosphere of the Antarctic plate. Magma contamination by Triassic–Early Tertiary clastic sediments deposited in the back-arc basin was only localized and affected Li isotopic composition in two of the samples, while most of the basalts show very little variation in δ7Li values, as anticipated for “mantle-driven” Li isotopic composition. These variations are difficult to resolve with radiogenic isotope systematics but Li isotopes may prove sensitive in tracking complex geochemical processes acting through the oceanic crust pile, including hydrothermal leaching and seawater equilibration.},

Several forestless episodes, dated to 5245e5155 cal BP, 4525 e4395 cal BP and 3940e3050 cal BP, were preceded by tree dying-off phases caused by an extreme periodical increase in humidity and general climate cooling trends. These events are documented based on analyses of pollen and non-pollen palynomorph assemblages, dendrochronological analyses of the trees, as well as numerous radiocarbon datings of the sediment horizons occurring within the peat bog profile. The phases of germinations, and, in turn, of tree and shrub invasions of the peat bog areas have been closely connected to drying and occasional warming of the regional climate. The last of the forestless periods began about 2600 years ago and continued up to the very recent times. Currently, as a result of desiccation of the peat bog and the lowering of the groundwater level (due to improved water drainage system), pine trees have returned the peat bog again. These results demonstrate that studies of subfossil bog-pine trees are quite effective in documenting and reconstructing periods of humidity fluctuation that occurred within the Carpathian region over the last several millennia.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a mechanical model that relates the destabilization of thawing permafrost rock slopes to temperature-related effects on both, rock- and ice-mechanics; and laboratory testing of key assumptions is performed. Degrading permafrost is considered to be an important factor for rock–slope failures in alpine and arctic environments, but the mechanics are poorly understood. The destabilization is commonly attributed to changes in ice-mechanical properties while bedrock friction and fracture propagation have not been considered yet. However, fracture toughness, compressive and tensile strength decrease by up to 50\% and more when intact water-saturated rock thaws. Based on literature and experiments, we develop a modified Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion for ice-filled rock fractures that incorporates fracturing of rock bridges, friction of rough fracture surfaces, ductile creep of ice and detachment mechanisms along rock–ice interfaces. Novel laboratory setups were developed to assess the temperature dependency of the friction of ice-free rock–rock interfaces and the shear detachment of rock–ice interfaces. In degrading permafrost, rock-mechanical properties may control early stages of destabilization and become more important for higher normal stress, i.e. higher magnitudes of rock–slope failure. Ice-mechanical properties outbalance the importance of rock-mechanical components after the deformation accelerates and are more relevant for smaller magnitudes. The model explains why all magnitudes of rock–slope failures can be prepared and triggered by permafrost degradation and is capable of conditioning long para-glacial response times. Here, we present a synoptic rock- and ice-mechanical model that explains the mechanical destabilization processes operating in warming permafrost rocks. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The severe rainfalls in Northern and Central Moravia and Eastern Bohemia in July 1997, triggered slope movements recorded particularly in the flysch-type rocks of Northern and Eastern Czech Republic. The basis of the diversified woodland and agricultural landscape of the Western Carpathians is the highland and mountain erosion–denudation and structure-denudation relief, which consists of flysch rock complexes. The geomorphological and geological setting is predisposed to extensive slope deformations––especially landslides. Slope movements play an important role in topography modelling and cause great direct and indirect damages in the countryside as well. Slope deformations of different intensity and aerial extent control the character of relief on the local or regional scale. Significant changes of land use may result from the slope movements, especially when the reclamation of the slope deformations are not undertaken. Landslides themselves have a great impact on the water regime of the landscape and consequently on the development of ecosystems. That is why they are often considered to be a significant biodiversity factor. It is also necessary to pay attention to the opposite effect since the land use (dispersed woody patches, landscape mosaic) is to a certain extent influencing the development and progress of the slope deformations. Based on the order we focused our geological investigations on the area in which the slope movements began to develop to such an extent that human lives and properties were considerably endangered. The total damages from activated landslides reached about 40 million USD. The landslide research differs in individual localities and their topical situations and is accompanied by a stability assessment of the locality and a proposal of rescue measures. An alternative solution should consist of an assessment of necessary changes in the area plans of affected villages, prospects of their future habitability, and displacements of engineering networks and roads.},

  abstract = {The shape of glacial cirques is generally considered to result from the combined actions of climate, topography, and geology. The goal of this article was to determine the dependence of cirque morphology on mesoclimatic conditions defined by altitude and aspect in the highest part of the Carpathians — the High Tatras. The morphology of each of 116 analyzed cirques was described using a set of 12 morphometric characteristics. The relationships between the obtained data were evaluated using simple and multivariate statistical methods. The results indicate that cirques in the High Tatras are scale-specific landforms with allometric development. Their occurrence increases with altitude, but their size decreases. The shape of the cirques is determined by altitude only to a small extent, with the exception of an increase in the degree of incision with altitude. The spatial distribution of cirques is negatively influenced by incoming solar radiation and positively influenced by moisture sources, which came mainly from the NW to N during the cold phases of the Pleistocene. For this reason, north-facing cirques have proportionally stronger representation and are more incised with steep slopes. Thus, cirques have proportionally stronger representation on the northern slopes and represent more developed glacial erosion landforms than those on the southern slopes. Although some relationships were detected between cirque morphology and mesoclimatic factors (such as altitude and aspect), a general discriminant analysis showed that these environmental factors did not explain variations in cirque morphology with sufficient cogency.},

  abstract = {Some of the most spectacular instances of deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) are found on Mars in the Valles Marineris region. They provide an excellent opportunity to study DSGSD phenomenology using a scaling approach. The topography of selected DSGSD scarps in Valles Marineris and in the Tatra Mountains is investigated after their likely similar postglacial origin is established. The deformed Martian ridges are larger than the deformed terrestrial ridges by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude with, however, a similar height-to-width ratio of ∼ 0.24. The measured horizontal spreading perpendicular to the ridges is proportionally 1.8 to 2.6 times larger for the Valles Marineris ridges than the Tatra Mountains and vertically 2.9 to 5.1 times larger, suggesting that starting from two different initial conditions, with steeper slopes in Valles Marineris, the final ridge geometry is now similar. Because DSGSD is expected to now be inactive in both regions, their comparison suggests that whatever the initial ridge morphology, DSGSD proceeds until a mature profile is attained. Fault displacements are therefore much larger on Mars. The large offsets imply reactivation of the DSGSD fault scarps in Valles Marineris, whereas single seismic events would be enough to generate DSGSD fault scarps in the Tatra Mountains. The required longer activity of the Martian faults may be correlated with a long succession of climate cycles generated by the unstable Martian obliquity.},

The variable geological structure of the West Carpathian crust is depicted in the equally variable magnetic field of this region. A sizable number of magnetic anomalies with manifold character have been recognized. The basic anomalies distribution was divided into two groups: anomalies connected with rocks of the pre-Neogene basement and anomalies which originate in Neogene and Quaternary volcanic products. Most of the significant anomalies in the pre-Neogene basement were interpreted, modelled and consequently its geological and tectonic classification was worked out. On the basis of the anomalous field features, the following sources of anomalies have been distinguished: a) known, located on the surface, or at shallow depths verified by boreholes, mainly expressed by simple morphology, b) deep-seated and expressed by complicated morphology, reinterpreted or newly interpreted and also problematic. According to our present knowledge the interpretations are insufficient and remain open for further investigation. The above mentioned sources of magnetic anomalies are classified in terms of tectonic provenience to the main tectonic units.},

This rock slide comprises a volume of 175,000\,m3, and indicates a partial reactivation at the front of the \textasciitilde 100 million m3 large postglacial Forkastningsfjellet rock slide. We studied the controlling and triggering factors of the reactivation using a 2-D limit-equilibrium calculations and a 3-D simulation with Scoops3D. Slope instability initiated along a pre-existing listric block fault that was inherited from the postglacial Forkastningsfjellet rock slide. The cause of the failure is attributed to a strength decrease and additional water pressures along the pre-existing sliding plane, possibly in combination with a degradation of the affected weak shales of the Rurikfjellet Formation, which build up a major part of the steep slope. Although the analysis suggests a structural control on the type and mechanism of slope failure, a significant impact of climate-related factors is inferred. Increasing temperatures and changing precipitation trends are reported from Svalbard. These are interpreted to foster permafrost degradation and reduce bonding forces in the thawing ice-filled fractures at the site. In addition, progressive weakening by more frequent frost and thaw cycles of the slaking shales and the introduction of additional water pressures to the rock mass are considered to contribute to the instability. The final trigger of the 2016 failure is attributed to a two-day rainfall that had preceded the event. The application of the Scoops3D software tool showed that it is capable of predicting the locations and affected volumes of landslides with reasonable accuracy, when the geological and structural setting is well established. Under such premises the tool can be used to support preliminary susceptibility assessments in study areas with comparable geological and morphostructural settings.},

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss the large-scale geomorphological characteristics of the Swiss Alps based on numerical analysis of a digital elevation model and compare these to an erodibility map constructed from a geotechnical map of Switzerland and regional geomorphological studies. Comparing the erodibility map with the large-scale morphometry shows an intimate relationship between mountain-scale erodibility and topography. On average, higher mean elevations and steeper mean slopes correlate with regions where rocks of low erodibility prevail. Areas with high peaks as well as the main water divides are controlled by the presence of bedrock with low to very low detachability. The drainage network of the Swiss Alps shows a close relationship to the lithological differences as well. Major longitudinal valleys follow easily erodible units. In the eastern and western part of the Swiss Alps, the highest values of local relief are located to the south of the main water divide, whereas in the central part, local relief is higher to the north of the main water divide. The large-scale geomorphic characteristics regarded in the framework of the geological history of uplift and denudation suggest that low and very low erodibilities lead to the development of areas of high elevations which are likely to persist over periods of 10–15 Ma. As the analysis of the Lepontine area shows, 20 Ma after cessation of exhumation, such high elevations are likely to be worn down and to manifest themselves as high relief only. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Research on permafrost carbon has dramatically increased in the past few years. A new estimate of 1672 Pg C of belowground organic carbon in the northern circumpolar permafrost region more than doubles the previous value and highlights the potential role of permafrost carbon in the Earth System. Uncertainties in this new estimate remain due to relatively few available pedon data for certain geographic sectors and the deeper cryoturbated soil horizons, and the large polygon size in the soil maps used for upscaling. The large permafrost carbon pool is not equally distributed across the landscape: peat deposits, cryoturbated soils and the loess-like deposits of the yedoma complex contain disproportionately large amounts of soil organic matter, often exhibiting a low degree of decomposition. Recent findings in Alaska and northern Sweden provide strong evidence that the deeper soil carbon in permafrost terrain is starting to be released, supporting previous reports from Siberia. The permafrost carbon pool is not yet fully integrated in climate and ecosystem models and an important objective should be to define typical pedons appropriate for model setups. The thawing permafrost carbon feedback needs to be included in model projections of future climate change. Copyright \# 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Hence, it is of utmost importance to select the right range of input physical and mechanical parameters based on laboratory or field estimation, and engineering judgment. Joint normal and shear stiffnesses are two popular input parameters to describe discontinuities in rock, which do not have specific guidelines for their estimation in literature. This study attempts to provide simple methods to estimate joint normal and shear stiffnesses in the laboratory using the uniaxial compression and small-scale direct shear tests. Samples have been prepared using rocks procured from different depths, geographical locations and formations. The study uses a mixture of relatively smooth natural joints and saw-cut joints in the various rock samples tested. The results indicate acceptable levels of uncertainty in the calculation of the stiffness parameters and provide a database of good first estimates and empirical relations which can be used for calculating values for joint stiffnesses when laboratory estimation is not possible. Joint basic friction angles have also been estimated as by-products in the small scale direct shear tests.},

  abstract = {New ground penetrating radar (GPR) observations on the Múlajökull surge-type outlet glacier, central Iceland, are presented. Overall 10.5~km of GPR profile lines were recorded parallel to the glacier margin in August, 2015. Detailed GPR investigations combined with high-accuracy GPS measurements allowed to build a high-resolution model of the subglacial topography. We provide new evidence of streamlined ridges beneath Múlajökull’s marginal zone interpreted as drumlins and show the location of the upper edge of the drumlin field. This discovery improves understanding of the location, morphology and development of drumlins as other geophysical observations of subglacial bedforms beneath modern outlet glaciers are quite rare. The location of drumlins corresponds with the position of the major sets of crevasses in the digital elevation model (2008) suggesting the presence of additional drumlins beneath such crevasses in the ice-marginal zone. We suggest this semi-circular pattern of crevasses to be formed due to the variable glacier strain rates created by the subglacial topography. Numerous hyperbolic diffractions representing reflections of englacial channels are found in radar profiles suggesting a well-developed channelized drainage system of a surge-type glacier in its quiescence phase. The calculated thinning of the ice surface in the investigated area (0.65~km2) is on average 17.9~m during 2008–2015.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an extended guide to reviewing for ESPL in particular and geomorphology in general. After a brief consideration of both how we choose reviewers and why we hope that reviewers will accept, I consider what makes a fair and constructive review. I note that we aim to publish papers with the rigour (r) necessary to sustain an original and significant contribution (q). I note that judging q is increasingly difficult because of the ever-growing size of the discipline (the Q). This is the sense in which we rarely have a full appreciation of Q, and our reviews are inevitably going to contain some bias. It is this bias that cannot be avoided (cf. Nicholas and Gordon, 2011) and makes the job of ESPL’s Editors of critical importance. With this in mind, I identify six elements of a good review: (1) an introductory statement that explains your assessment of your competences in relation to the manuscript (r and Q); (2) a summative view of the originality and significance of the manuscript (q) in relation to Q: (3) a summative view of the methodological rigour of the manuscript (r); (4) identification and justification of any major concerns; (5) identification of any minor issues to be corrected if you think the manuscript merits eventual publication; and (6) note of any typographical or presentation issues to be addressed although this latter activity is also an editorial responsibility. In addition, I note the importance of a constructive review, grounded in what is written in the manuscript, justified where appropriate and avoiding reference to personal views as far as is possible. I conclude with a discussion of whether or not you should sign your review openly and the importance of reviewer confidentiality. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The Wellington Fault is a major active, right lateral, strike-slip fault in southern North Island that can be divided into three distinct geometric sections based on changes in neotectonic character and structural complexities. These are, from south to north: the Wellington-Hutt Valley segment; Tararua section; and Pahiatua section. The Pahiatua section is a 42 km long, straight, NNE-striking fault section defined between two geometric endpoints near Putara in the south and Woodville. This section has been mapped in detail and exhibits classic strike-slip tectonic geomorphology and late Quaternary dextral displacements of up to 125 m. Three trenches excavated at sites along the Pahiatua section are used to define the dextral slip rate for this section. At Bennett trench site, a stream is dextrally deflected 50 ± 6 m. Peaty silts underlying "deflected" channel deposits in the trench yield an age of 8390-8700 cal. yr BP, providing a minimum dextral slip rate of 5.1-6.7 mm/yr. At Hughes 1 site, a stream is deflected 60 ± 5 m. Peaty material found stratigraphically above the deflection there was dated (10 500-11 160 cal. yr BP), yielding a maximum slip rate of 4.9-6.2 mm/yr for this displacement. Ebbett 1 trench was excavated across the fault zone where a smaller displacement (18 ± 2 m) yielded a slip rate range of 3.2-5.2 mm/yr. Our preferred dextral slip rate (5.1-6.2 mm/yr) comes from the combination of the minimum and maximum rates from Bennett and Hughes 1 sites. This range is generally lower than (but slightly overlaps) that for the Wellington-Hutt Valley segment (6-7.6 mm/yr). The single-event displacement range for the Pahiatua section determined from field measurements is 4.5 ± 1 m. From this data we calculate a recurrence interval for surface-rupturing earthquakes of 564-1080 yr.},

A GIS extension, RockFall Analyst (RA), which is capable of effectively handling large amounts of geospatial information relative to rockfall behaviors, has been developed in ArcGIS using ArcObjects and C\#. The 3D rockfall model considers dynamic processes on a cell plane basis. It uses inputs of distributed parameters in terms of raster and polygon features created in GIS. Two major components are included in RA: particle-based rockfall process modeling and geostatistics-based rockfall raster modeling. Rockfall process simulation results, 3D rockfall trajectories and their velocity features either for point seeders or polyline seeders are stored in 3D shape files. Distributed raster modeling, based on 3D rockfall trajectories and a spatial geostatistical technique, represents the distribution of spatial frequency, the flying and/or bouncing height, and the kinetic energy of falling rocks. A distribution of rockfall hazard can be created by taking these rockfall characteristics into account. A barrier analysis tool is also provided in RA to aid barrier design. An application of these modeling techniques to a case study is provided. The RA has been tested in ArcGIS 8.2, 8.3, 9.0 and 9.1.},

GIS-based geomorphological mapping reveals five sets of moraines in glacial phases assigned to the Late Pleistocene. The most extensive glacier was in western Buha escu valley and had a surface area of 5 km2 and a length of 4.2 km and reached down to an altitude of 1086 m. Several methods were tested to determine the former ELAs of the glaciers. Using sizespecific AAR, the average ELA for the oldest phase was 1765 m and rose to 1865, 1960, 2001 and 2025 m. The last and youngest phase was characterised only by cirque glaciers. Comparison with previous studies shows that extents were over-estimated.},

  abstract = {GIS features provide simple and useful tools for landslides susceptibility and hazard studies, allowing the identification and the quantification of predisposing factors, and their relative importance. In lithologically homogeneous areas, the most influent factor of landslides is slope morphometry, in particular inclination, height and form. Moreover, within a hydrographic basin, landslides are coupled with drainage network. In fact landslides density and drainage density are positively correlated. Furthermore, human activity strongly influences the development of landslides. In our previous works, we introduced MSI (Morphometric Slope Index) as general index for slope morphometry, combining the main linear and areal morphometric features (area, form, length, inclination, width). Its formula is: ܯܵܫ = ܣଷ஽Τܣଶ஽ ή ܮ ή ܴ௖ (where A3D is the three-dimensional area of the slope, A2D is its plan area, L is the slope length and Rc is the circularity ratio). We tested MSI as driver of different erosion landforms, demonstrating its influence in determining, on the one hand, the development and the final arrangement of calanchi drainage network (the typical Italian badlands), and, on the other hand, the erosion processes within them, mainly gullies and landslides.},

A close relationship could be found between the thickness of weathering rinds and the Schmidt-hammer rebound value, which correlates with absolute age determination methods. A logistic model was applied to the modal values to describe the correlation between time and weathering rind development. Rock weathering rinds found in the Upper Engadine were usually much thinner than those observed by other authors on sandstones (New Zealand). Chemical analyses of the weathering rinds gave a steady increase of dithionite-extractable Fe with age. This easily determinable Fe fraction also seems therefore to be a suitable indicator of the age of the weathering rind.},

  abstract = {Large areas of the Norwegian fjord landscapes are covered by hillslopes that reflect the influence of glacial inheritance from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The focus of this paper is two-fold: (1) analyze the spatio-temporal variability of relevant denudational slope processes and process intensities over the Holocene; and (2) detect Holocene modification of the glacial valley morphometry. Research was performed on hillslope systems within two steep, parabolic-shaped and glacier-fed tributary valleys, Erdalen and Bødalen located on the western side of the Jostedalsbreen ice cap in western Norway. Orthophoto delineation, high resolution mapping (TLS), detailed geomorphological information and spatial data analysis were combined with dating techniques and geophysical investigations. Calculated Holocene rockwall retreat rates at selected slope test sites range from 0.38 to 0.67 mm yr−1, with a mean value of 0.53 mm yr−1. Slightly higher values were found in Erdalen, with a mean rockwall retreat rate of 0.57 mm yr−1 compared to 0.50 mm yr−1 in Bødalen. Valley-wide Holocene rockwall retreat rates of 0.38–0.50 mm yr−1 are consistent with other estimates of Holocene rockwall retreat rates in cold mountain environments. It is shown that the glacial inheritance of topography is the most important factor controlling valley development since the LGM and that sediment storage capacity is primarily conditioned by valley morphometry. Compared to contemporary rates, the results indicate enhanced denudation activity and intensity immediately following deglaciation and during the ‘Little Ice Age’. The overall tendency of landscape development is postglacial widening of the parabolic-shaped valley morphometry through rockwall retreat with associated debris accumulation beneath rockwalls. As a result, the glacially sculpted topography has not yet adapted to denudational processes acting under Holocene environmental conditions.},

The rate of lake sedimentation (0.86 ± 0.57 mm yr−1) also provided us with the approximate age of the landslide: 1106 ± 540 yr. The CRE dating result highlights two main slope destabilization phases. Then we discussed the history of DSL activity and its controlling factors.

  abstract = {Uncertainty regarding the relative efficacy of fluvial and glacial erosion has hindered attempts to quantitatively analyse the Pleistocene evolution of alpine landscapes. Here we show that the morphology of major tributaries of the Rhone River, Switzerland, is consistent with that predicted for a landscape shaped primarily by multiple phases of fluvial incision following a period of intense glacial erosion after the mid-Pleistocene transition (∼0.7 Ma). This is despite major ice sheets reoccupying the region during cold intervals since the mid-Pleistocene. We use high-resolution LiDAR data to identify a series of convex reaches within the long-profiles of 18 tributary channels. We propose these reaches represent knickpoints, which developed as regional uplift raised tributary bedrock channels above the local fluvial baselevel during glacial intervals, and migrated upstream as the fluvial system was re-established during interglacial periods. Using a combination of integral long-profile analysis and stream-power modelling, we find that the locations of ∼80\% of knickpoints in our study region are consistent with that predicted for a fluvial origin, while the mean residual error over ∼100 km of modelled channels is just 26.3 m. Breaks in cross-valley profiles project toward the elevation of former end-of-interglacial channel elevations, supporting our model results. Calculated long-term uplift rates are within ∼15\% of present-day measurements, while modelled rates of bedrock incision range from ∼1 mm/yr for low gradient reaches between knickpoints to ∼6–10 mm/yr close to retreating knickpoints, typical of observed rates in alpine settings. Together, our results reveal approximately 800 m of regional uplift, river incision, and hillslope erosion in the lower half of each tributary catchment since 0.7 Ma.},

  abstract = {The stability of rock slopes is often guided significantly by the structural geology of the rocks composing the slope. In this work, we analysed the influences of structural characteristics, and of their seismic responses, on large and deep-seated rock slope failure development. The study was focused on the Tamins and Fernpass rockslides in the European Alps and on the Balta and Eagle’s Lake rockslides in the southeastern Carpathians. These case studies were compared with catastrophic rock slope failures with ascertained or very likely seismic origin in the Tien Shan Mountains. The main goals was to identify indicators for seismically-induced rock slope failures based on the source zone rock structures and failure scar geometry. We present examples of failures in anti-dip slopes and along-strike rock structures that were potentially (or partially) caused by seismic triggering, and we also considered a series of mixed structural types, which are more difficult to interpret conclusively. Our morpho-structural study was supported by distinct element numerical modelling that showed that seismic shaking typically induces deep-seated deformation in initially “stable” rock slopes. In addition, for failures partially triggered by dynamic shaking, these studies can help identify the contribution of the seismic factor to slope instability. The identification of the partial seismic origin on the basis of the dynamic response of rock structures can be particularly interesting for case histories in less seismically active mountain regions (in comparison with the Andes, Tien Shan, Pamirs), such as in the European Alps and the Carpathian Mountains.},

  abstract = {In the recently published paper by Tîrlă and Vijulie (2013), the authors interpret the abundant trenches affecting the limestone ridge of the Vânturariţa-Buila Massif (Southern Carpathians, Romania) as bogaz-like landforms (syn. kluftkarren, karst corridors, karst streets, zanjones etc.). These karst features originated, according to the authors, through the corrosion of structurally anisotropic limestone bedrock. This proposed origin is supported by a comparison of the rose diagrams of the directions of both bogaz and tectonic discontinuities, by a morphometric analysis and by observations of the speleothem remnants covering the exposed fault surfaces. Furthermore, the authors described the typically karstic settings of the area, such as extremely poor surface drainage, subterranean connections between the karst corridors and karst springs in pocket valleys. We disagree with their main interpretations and argue that the presumed bogaz are gravitationally-induced grabens and trenches created by mass movement activity, namely by deep-seated slope failures. The speleothem remnants are interpreted as flowstones deposited during the subsurface widening of the joints by gravitational activity. These speleothem remnants became fossil (and even rotated from the original position) after sufficient widening of the joints and subsequent exposure of the crevices to the surface due to slope failure progression. The morphology of the slope failure along the Vânturariţa-Buila Massif is similar to numerous other elevated ridges within the Carpathian Mountains.},

Crevice-type caves allow us to visit and observe the inner environment of the slope deformations. Such caves are typically composed of systems comprising long and high joint-predisposed corridors, enabling us to investigate geological outcrops hundreds of meters long and tens of meters deep within the landslide mass. The present paper shows the diversity of particular gravitational movements influencing the vast slid rock blocks, which seem to remain intact and consolidated within the landslide body. By use of geological compass measurement and statistical evaluation, we detect complex movement mechanisms in most investigated cases, often without any impact on the topography above. The results prove the existence of a great difference between the overall behavior of the deformation and its individual rock blocks, as well as discrepancy between movement mechanisms detected in crevice-type caves and by formal investigation. Furthermore, this paper discusses the related horizontal rotation and subsidence movements documented by previous studies. We can conclude that most deformations are complex.},

These caves present complex and peculiar underground systems with their own development and resulting landforms. We investigated eight caves in the Czech part of the Outer Western Carpathians to determine their genesis, types and evolution. Crevice formation is predisposed according to the lithological, tectonic and morphological characteristics of the landslide body, including the position and location of bedding planes, joints and faults. We performed several analyses, including speleological mapping, evaluation of highresolution topography above the caves, geophysical (ERT) measurements and structural investigations within cave passages. In accordance with these analyses, various mechanisms responsible for cave development were revealed. An intra-bed translation is responsible for the creation of regularly shaped passages with flat ceilings. Toppling as well as back and horizontal rotation of rock blocks determine the specific morphology and shapes of passages. A relatively novel aspect of the current study is the identification of the subsidence of massive rock wedges due to the widening of cracks. All of these mechanisms control the specific morphological characteristics within crevices, e.g., typical shapes of passages, cave level ordering and ceiling types. Some of these processes also influence topography above the caves. Finally, the different phases of evolution of these caves were determined.},

  abstract = {The subject of this study is selection of mathematical description (interpolation method) of landslides surface for the purpose of periodic control of terrain movements. Monitoring of landslides, considered in this work, concerns points of periodic GPS or tacheometric measurements carried out in a relatively regular grid. For economic reasons, the grid usually consists of limited group of about several dozen of points that do not allow for an exact description of the terrain surface, nevertheless a general movement of a landslide can be detected (observed). Replacement of discrete set of points to a continuous surface model allows for a better assessment of the phenomenon especially within the scope of its main directions of activity. The choice of best performing interpolation method in order to construct a reliable numerical terrain model was performed through tests carried out on complex model surfaces. These model surfaces encompassed various configurations of terrain relief. In this study four interpolation methods i.e. splines, kriging triangulation with linear interpolation and IDW are compared. Tests on model surfaces distinguished the method of splines as the best performing one as well as the method of kriging which is suitable in some instances. The selected method of splines was then applied to periodically monitored landslide in Milówka in the south of Poland. Interpolation by means of splines allowed for observing progressive movements of the landslide surface with accuracy up to several millimeters. This confirms the usefulness and reliability of this method in landslides monitoring. Specialized field: Surveying \& Geo-Spatial Engineering : Deformation Surveying.},

The final data set of earthquakes covers the time span from 1267 to 2004 and comprises 1968 earthquakes in total. The resulting epicentral map provides a very detailed idea of the seismicity of this region. An attempt at a seismotectonic interpretation of earthquakes based on the geological overview of the region is presented. Gravity and airborne magnetometry data in addition to seismic events are collected and cross-border maps are compiled and analysed in order to determine the spatial extent of these geological structures. The Linsser filtering technique is used to trace faults at two depth horizons – 4 and 8 km. Correlation between the epicentres of earthquakes and lineaments derived from gravity data is discussed for major historical earthquakes such as Neulengbach (1590) or Scheibbs (1867). This data set enables us to determine seismically active fault structures and to get an insight into the fault system interaction. The ability to assess the potentially seismically active vertical and horizontal extent of fault structures enables improved hazard assessments in future. The magnetometric map shows a belt of positive anomalies which reflects the presence of magnetized rocks between the Bohemian Massif and the Alpine-Carpathian zone.},

  abstract = {Cosmic Ray Exposure (CRE) dating applied to the active Séchilienne landslide (Romanche valley, Belledonne Massif, French Alps) provides information about its Holocene dynamics from initiation to present day activity. Glacier retreat at 1100 m a.s.l. is estimated at 16.6 ± 0.6 10Be ka from glacially polished bedrock samples, with total deglaciation of the valley achieved at least by 13.3 ka. Application of the CRE method along vertical profiles sampled with a high spatial resolution of 3 m on the head scarp yields: (1) an initiation of the rock-slope failure at 6.4 ± 1.4 10Be ka and (2) a continuous rock-slope failure activity with a mean head scarp exposure rate of 0.6 cm/yr. The data suggest an increase of the head scarp exposure rate between 2.3 and 1.0 ka. After this acceleration phase, the exposure rate is similar to that obtained by the present day monitoring data over 20 years in the depletion zone (1.3 cm/yr). Since the failure initiation occurred more than 5400 yr after the total deglaciation of the valley the slope failure does not appear as an immediate consequence of debutressing in the Romanche valley. This result is consistent with studies of other large alpine rockslides in the Alps. Failure initiation of the Séchilienne landslide occurred during the Holocene Climatic Optimum, a hot and wet period. The temperature and precipitation changes of this climatic optimum seem to have a worsening effect at the regional scale to trigger large mass wasting in this glacial alpine valley.},

  abstract = {Fifty active-layer detachment failures triggered after forest fire in the discontinuous permafrost zone (central Mackenzie Valley, 658 N.) are compared to several hundred others caused by summer meteorological triggers in continuous permafrost (Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, 808N). Most failures fall into compact or elongated morphological categories. The compact type occur next to stream channels and have little internal disturbance of the displaced block, whereas the elongated types can develop on any part of the slope and exhibit greater internal deformation. Frequency distributions of length-to-width and length-to-depth ratios are similar at all sites. Positive pore pressures, expected theoretically, were measured in the field at the base of the thawing layer. Effective stress analysis could predict the instability of slopes in both areas, providing cohesion across the thaw plane was set to zero and/or residual strength parameters were employed. The location of the shear planes or zones in relation to the permafrost table and the degree of post-failure secondary movements (including headwall recession and thermokarst development within the failure track) differed between the localities, reflecting dissimilarity in the environmental triggers and in the degree of ground thermal disturbance.},

  abstract = {Topographic shielding (TS) is an important factor in cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating. The development of geographic information systems (GIS) and the availability of digital elevation models (DEMs) make it possible to derive this factor directly from a DEM. Most available GIS models derive the TS factors for an area (all cells in a DEM) without the consideration of surface conditions of individual sites, such as the strike, dip, and height above ground, into the calculation. This paper presents a new GIS model to derive the TS factors for discrete sample sites. This model uses the Skyline and Skyline Graph functions in ArcGIS to extract the set of azimuth and elevation angles of topographic obstructions around each site from a DEM (considering the sample height above ground) and then incorporates the strike and dip information of the sample surface to derive the TS factor. All processing tools and steps are streamlined in ArcGIS modelbuilder and this model can be run like a standard ArcGIS geoprocessing tool. It provides an easy and user-friendly means to derive the TS factors for discrete samples based on a DEM and the measured strike, dip and sample height for each site.},

The basis for the calculations is reference to surfaces of different age. Glacial erosion is responsible for merely polishing the northern shields.

It was re-exposed successively during the Mesozoic and Tertiary with denudation amounting to 600 m at the most. Glacial erosion can generally be counted in tens of metres though with great variations. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Human-induced modifications of the vegetation cover in river basins may cause strong geomorphic responses by disturbing sediment supply, transport and deposition regimes. The response is particularly noticeable in upland regions, where sensitivity to change is enhanced by strong coupling between river channels and hillslopes, as is exemplified by studies undertaken in the East Coast region, North Island, New Zealand, and in the Southern French Prealps. Both regions have been affected by land-use change during the past 150 years (deforestation and reforestation) that can be chronologically linked to geomorphic change on hillslopes and on valley floors. In this paper we use these studies to draw attention to: (1) the magnitude of the change in sediment production associated with a modification to the vegetation cover; (2) the impact that reforestation has on the sediment production and the channel system; and (3) the relative influence of anthropogenic and climatic forcing on the channel response. Finally, we consider the manner in which land use has been used as a tool to manage sediment production in France and New Zealand. The results obtained in both regions demonstrate the strong effect that the vegetation cover has on hillslope erosion processes, through its impact on the landsliding threshold (in New Zealand) and the total sediment yield (from paired forested and non-forested catchments in France). Consideration of channel response serves to emphasize the sensitivity of upland regions to land-use change, and suggests that the successful discrimination between the respective influences of climatic and land-use change depends, in large part, upon the ability to detect spatial and chronological links (or, conversely, gaps) between causes and effects.

The geometric signature of glacial topography has been quantified in various ways, but the temporal development of landscape metrics has not been traced in a landscape evolution model so far. However, such information is needed to interpret the degree of glacial imprint in terms of the integrated signal of temporal and spatial variations in erosion as a function of glacial occupation time. We apply a surface process model for cold-climate conditions to an initially fluvial mountain range. By exploring evolving topographic patterns in model time series, we determine locations where topographic changes reach a maximum and where the initial landscape persists. The signal of glacial erosion, expressed by the overdeepening of valleys and the steepening of valley flanks, develops first at the glacier front and migrates upstream with ongoing glacial erosion. This leads to an increase of mean channel slope and its variance. Above steep flanks and head-walls, however, the observed mean channel slope remains similar to the mean channel slope of the initial fluvial topography. This leads to a characteristic turning point in the channel slope–elevation distribution above the equilibrium line altitude, where a transition from increasing to decreasing channel slope with elevation occurs. We identify this turning point and a high channel slope variance as diagnostic features to quantify glacial imprint. Such features are abundant in glacially imprinted mid-latitude mountain ranges such as the Eastern Alps. By analysing differently glaciated parts of the mountain range, we observe a decreasing clarity of this diagnostic morphometric property with decreasing glacial occupation. However, catchments of the unglaciated eastern fringe of the Alps also feature turning points in their channel slope–elevation distributions, but in contrast to the glaciated domain, the variance of channel slope is small at all elevation levels.},

  abstract = {Background: Landslide size distribution is widely found to obey a negative power law with a rollover in the smaller size, and has been exploited by many researchers to inspect landside physics or to assess landslide erosion and landslide hazard. Yet, sample size has effect on the statistics of landslide size even though we manage to avoid complications associated with landslide datasets and statistical treatments. Results: In this paper, a series of stochastic simulations were implemented to explicitly and systematically quantify the effect of sample size. The results show that, the errors of parameters estimated based on small sample size can be considerably large. For a sample size of 100, the relative error of the estimated landslide erosion rate that has a probability of 50 \% can approach 100 \%. In addition, small sample size also obscures the statistical significance of the variances in parameters between different subsets of the same dataset. Although inconsistency was found regarding how the power exponent varies with rainfall intensity, numerical results suggest that the variance observed in a dataset with a small sample size may be not statistically significant. Conclusions: This paper not only reveals the potential effect of sample size on exploiting landslide size distribution but also presents procedures for quantifying this issue in future studies.},

In this edition, the basics of analogue image analysis are still provided, but greater emphasis is placed on digitally based systems and analysis techniques. Hence, the subject matter contained in this book ranges from the principles of airphoto interpretation and photogrammetry, to a description of next generation satellite systems and recent developments in digital image processing. The close interaction among the related areas of remote sensing, GIS, GPS digital image processing and environmental modelling is also discussed. New or expanded coverage is provided on such topics as the GPS Wide-Area Augmentation System, digital cameras, new satellite systems, image interpretation for natural disaster assessment, hyperspectral sensing, lidar, change detection, and biophysical modelling via remote sensing data. A new appendix is also included on radiation measurement concepts, terminology and units, which could prove to be very useful to those interested in the more quantitative aspects of remote sensing. Similarly, a new appendix is added dealing with sample coordinate transformation and resampling procedures. Additional appendix material includes sources of remote sensing data and information, remote sensing periodicals, online glossaries, and online tutorials. This edition also has many new line drawings and photographic illustrations, and a greatly expanded number of colour plates.},

Traditionally, loesses are classified as glacial, desert, or other types based only on source area characteristics without taking into account provenance and transportation. Research on loess genesis is often local with only a few attempts at systematically overviewing worldwide loess distribution. Both the local and few global studies lack information on the variability in loess thickness, continuity, and areal extent. This review integrates a large body of information on loess source areas and transportation pathways and the existence of desert transition zones. Three modes of loess genesis, (1) continental glacier provenance-river transport, (2) mountain provenance-river transport, and (3) mountain provenance-river transport-desert transition, were identified. Global distribution maps of provenance and transport pathways of major loess areas and their different genesis modes were meticulously prepared. Maps showing the spatial distribution, thickness, and continuity of loess deposits were also composed and the sizes of loess-covered areas of each continent were re-estimated. The main features related to the distribution of the loess deposits on each continent are summarized for different regions or as a whole depending on the coverage of the source maps and references.},

Data for drainage density, slope angle, and relative height for 88 subwatersheds were obtained from the DEMs and derived stream-nets. The relationship between drainage density and slope angle for each subwatershed can be divided into two types: downward sloping and convex upward. Although previous studies suggested that drainage density positively correlates with slope angle if overland flow is dominant, this correlation seldom occurs in the study areas. The two types of drainage density – slope angle relationships correspond to differing channelization stages that reflect the extension and integration of existing channels, as well as the formation of new low-order streams in response to base-level lowering. The location of subwatersheds within each study area seems to play a major role in determining the stages of channel development and, in turn, the types of drainage density – slope angle relationships.},

  abstract = {The evolution of landscapes crucially depends on the climate history. This is particularly evident in South America where landscape responses to orbital climate shifts have been well documented. However, while most studies have focused on inferring temperature variations from paleoclimate proxy data, estimates of water budget changes have been complicated because of a lack of adequate physical information. Here, we present a methodology and related results, which allowed us to extract water discharge values from the sedimentary record of the 40 Ka-old fluvial terrace deposits in the Pisco valley, western Peru. In particular, this valley hosts a Quaternary cut-and-fill succession that we used, in combination with 10Be-based sediment flux, gauging records, channel geometries and grain size measurements, to quantitatively assess sediment and water discharge values c. 40 Ka ago in relation to present-day conditions. We compare these discharge estimates to the discharge regime of the modern Pisco River and find that the water discharge of the paleo-Pisco River, during the Minchin pluvial period c. 40 Ka ago, was c. 7-8 times greater than the modern Pisco River if considering the mean and the maximum water discharge. In addition, the calculations show that inferred water discharge estimates are mainly dependent on channel gradients and grain size values, and to a lesser extent on channel width measures. Finally, we found that the c. 40 Ka-old Minchin terrace material was poorer sorted than the modern deposits, which might reflect that sediment transport during the past period was characterized by a larger divergence from equal mobility compared to the modern situation. In summary, the differences in grain size distribution and inferred water discharge estimates between the modern and the paleo-Pisco River suggests that the 40 Ka-old Minchin period was characterized by a wetter climate and more powerful flood events.},

  abstract = {Power law scaling has been widely observed in the frequency distribution of landslide sizes. The exponent of the power-law characterizes the probability of landslide magnitudes and it thus represents an important parameter for hazard assessment. The reason for the universal scaling behavior of landslides is still debated and the role of topography has been explored in terms of possible explanation for this type of behavior. We built a simple cellular automata model to investigate this issue, as well as the relationships between the scaling properties of landslide areas and the changes suffered by the topographic surface affected by landslides. The dynamics of the model is controlled by a temporal rate of weakening, which drives the system to instability, and by topography, which defines both the quantity of the displaced mass and the direction of the movement. Results show that the model is capable of reproducing the scaling behavior of real landslide areas and suggest that topography is a good candidate to explain their scale-invariance. In the model, the values of the scaling exponents depend on how fast the system is driven to instability; they are less sensitive to the duration of the driving rate, thus suggesting that the probability of landslide areas could depend on the intensity of the triggering mechanism rather than on its duration, and on the topographic setting of the area. Topography preserves the information concerning the statistical distribution of areas of landslides caused by a driving mechanism of given intensity and duration.},

The models simulate collapse of granular slopes and focus on the spatial and temporal distribution of their internal structures. Using a series of systematically designed models, we have studied the effect of friction and deformability of the runout base on internal deformation within a granular slope. The results of these different models show that the collapse of granular slopes resulted in different-generation extensional faults at the back of the slope, and contractional structures (overturned folds, sheath folds and thrusts) at the toe of the slope. The failure surfaces and the volume of the failure mass changed both spatially and temporally. Younger failure surfaces formed in the back of the older ones by incorporating additional new material from the head of the slope. Our model results also show that the nature of the runout base has a significant influence on the runout distance, topography and internal deformation of a granular slope. Model results are compared with natural landslides where local profiles were dug in order to decipher the internal structures of the failure mass. The natural cases show similar structural distribution at the head and toe of the failure mass. As in model results, our field observations indicate the presence of at least two generations of failure surfaces where the older ones are steeper.},

Onsite surveys, terrain analysis, and UDEC numerical models were used to describe the characteristics of gravity-driven deformation under various conditions and identify the process of slate deformation as well as potential failure mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that valley erosion and slope toe soaking mechanisms play key roles in the deformation of slate and accelerate the weakening of slate material. Comparisons of material strength of rock and foliation, the location of erosion gullies, and the inclination of the foliation indicate that a reduction in the strength of rock material and foliation expanded the range of slate deformation. The inclination of foliation is the most important factor in the deformation of slate and the location of erosion gullies has relatively little influence. Slate deformation was shown to begin in the tension zone at the cliff top, wherein the slope body slips along the highly inclined foliation, contributing to shear failure or composite failure near the eroded zone of weakness. The phenomenon of foliation opening was widespread within the area of deformation, enabling surface water and groundwater to seep in, thereby accelerating failure in the slate deformation zone.},

A large quantity of colluvium has accumulated on the slopes and in upstream and midstream gullies.

The results of physical model tests indicate that increasing the foliation dip angle, the thickness and the length of sliding mass, particle size (spacing between foliations) increases the depth of slope deformation. Foliation dip angle is the most critical factor that controls the deformation of slate slopes. When the cataclinal slopes reached maximum deformation, a shear failure and translational slide occurred within a short period. The deformation zone exhibited significant cracking at the scarp and the bulging of the slope toe, which facilitated the infiltration of surface water and groundwater, accelerating the deformation to failure.},

This technique is based on the smoothness-constrained least-squares method and it produces a two-dimensional subsurface model from the apparent resistivity pseudosection. In the first iteration, a homogeneous earth model is used as the starting model for which the apparent resistivity partial derivative values can be calculated analytically. For subsequent iterations, a quasi-Newton method is used to estimate the partial derivatives which reduces the computer time and memory space required by about eight and twelve times, respectively, compared to the conventional least-squares method. Tests with a variety of computer models and data from field surveys show that this technique is insensitive to random noise and converges rapidly. This technique takes about one minute to invert a single data set on an 80486DX microcomputer.},

A 3D discrete element program, PFC3D was used to model the kinematic process that led to the landslide and destruction of Hsiaolin village. The landslide advanced from debris slide to debris avalanche during the kinematic process. Assuming a friction coefficient of each particle of 0.1, the predicted maximum velocity was about 70 m/s, a velocity which permits the debris to cross Qishanxi stream and deposit on the opposite bank. Based on simulation results, Hsiaolin village was inundated in 60 to 65 s after failure initiation and at 112 s after the event, the debris avalanche came to rest, forming a landslide dam.},

  abstract = {The standard definition of landslide hazard requires the estimation of where, when (or how frequently) and how large a given landslide event may be. The geomorphological community involved in statistical models has addressed the component pertaining to how large a landslide event may be by introducing the concept of landslide-event magnitude scale. This scale, which depends on the planimetric area of the given population of landslides, in analogy to the earthquake magnitude, has been expressed with a single value per landslide event. As a result, the geographic or spatially-distributed estimation of how large a population of landslide may be when considered at the slope scale, has been disregarded in statistically-based landslide hazard studies. Conversely, the estimation of the landslide extent has been commonly part of physically-based applications, though their implementation is often limited to very small regions. In this work, we initially present a review of methods developed for landslide hazard assessment since its first conception decades ago. Subsequently, we introduce for the first time a statistically-based model able to estimate the planimetric area of landslides aggregated per slope units. More specifically, we implemented a Bayesian version of a Generalized Additive Model where the maximum landslide sizes per slope unit and the sum of all landslide sizes per slope unit are predicted via a Log-Gaussian model. These ``max'' and ``sum'' models capture the spatial distribution of landslide sizes. We tested these models on a global dataset expressing the distribution of co-seismic landslides due to 24 earthquakes across the globe. The two models we present are both evaluated on a suite of performance diagnostics that suggest our models suitably predict the aggregated landslide extent per slope unit. In addition to a complex procedure involving variable selection and a spatial uncertainty estimation, we built our model over slopes where landslides triggered in response to seismic shaking, and simulated the expected failing surface over slopes where the landslides did not occur in the past. What we achieved is the first statistically-based model in the literature able to provide information about the extent of the failed surface across a given landscape. This information is vital in landslide hazard studies and should be combined with the estimation of landslide occurrence locations. This could ensure that governmental and territorial agencies have a complete probabilistic overview of how a population of landslides could behave in response to a specific trigger. The predictive models we present are currently valid only for the 24 cases we tested. Statistically estimating landslide extents is still at its infancy stage. Many more applications should be successfully validated before considering such models in an operational way. For instance, the validity of our models should still be verified at the regional or catchment scale, as much as it needs to be tested for different landslide types and triggers. However, we envision that this new spatial predictive paradigm could be a breakthrough in the literature and, in time, could even become part of official landslide risk assessment protocols.},

Samples of granite, conglomerate, sandstone, dolomite, limestone and amphibolite were sourced in the Chochołowska Valley, Tatra Mts. The simulation project, which continues at the Low Temperature Laboratory of the Jagiellonian University, Cracow, is set to quantify the resistance of the rocks to frost weathering by measuring the number of gelation cycles after which the samples are damaged. At the end of the project, the degree of damage will be assessed using the percentage loss of the initial sample weight and a frost weathering indicator. So far, little damage has been recorded overall, with the dolomite samples losing the highest percentage of their initial weight at nearly 6\%. The paper also presents results of physical tests of the rocks, including their strength, porosity and density, which provide a useful insight into the interpretation of differences in frost weathering resistance.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission is the most accurate near-global elevation model that is publicly available. However, it contains many data voids, mostly in mountainous terrain. This problem is particularly severe in the rugged Oman Mountains. This study presents a method to fill these voids using a fill surface derived from Russian military maps. For this we developed a new method, which is based on Triangular Irregular Networks (TINs). For each void, we extracted points around the edge of the void from the SRTM DEM and the fill surface. TINs were calculated from these points and converted to a base surface for each dataset. The fill base surface was subtracted from the fill surface, and the result added to the SRTM base surface. The fill surface could then seamlessly be merged with the SRTM DEM. For validation, we compared the resulting DEM to the original SRTM surface, to the fill DEM and to a surface calculated by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) from the SRTM data. We calculated the differences between measured GPS positions and the respective surfaces for 187,500 points throughout the mountain range (∆GPS). Comparison of the means and standard deviations of these values showed that for the void areas, the fill surface was most accurate, with a standard deviation of the ∆GPS from the mean ∆GPS of 69 m, and only little accuracy was lost by merging it to the SRTM surface (standard deviation of 76 m). The CIAT model was much less accurate in these areas (standard deviation of 128 m).},

  abstract = {A widespread risk in high mountains is related to the accumulation of loose sediments on steep slopes, which represent potential sources of different types of geomorphic processes including debris flows. This paper combines data on 50 yr of permafrost creep at the Ritigraben rock glacier (Valais, Swiss Alps) with magnitude–frequency (M–F) relationships of debris flows recorded in the Ritigraben torrent originating at the rock-glacier front. Debris production and volumetric changes at the rock-glacier front are compared with debris-flow activity recorded on the cone and potential couplings and feedbacks between debris sources, channel processes and debris sinks. The dataset existing for the Ritigraben rock glacier and its debris-flow system is unique and allows prime insights into controls and dynamics of permafrost processes and related debris-flow activity in a constantly changing and warming high-altitude environment. Acceleration in rockglacier movement rates is observed in the (1950s and) 1960s, followed by a decrease in flow rates by the 1970s, before movements increase again after the early 1990s. At a decadal scale, measured changes in rockglacier movements at Ritigraben are in concert with changes in atmospheric temperatures in the Alps. Geodetic data indicates displacement rates in the frontal part of the rock glacier of up to 0.6–0.9 m yr−1 since the beginning of systematic measurements in 1995. While the Ritigraben rock glacier has always formed a sediment reservoir for the associated debris-flow system, annual horizontal displacement rates of the rockglacier body have remained quite small and are in the order of decimeters under current climatic conditions. Sediment delivery from the rock-glacier front alone could not therefore be sufficient to support the 16 debris flows reconstructed on the cone since 1958. On the contrary, debris accumulated at the foot of the rock glacier, landslide and rockfall activity as well as the partial collapse of oversteepened channel walls have to be seen as important sediment sources of debris flows at Ritigraben and would represent 65–90\% of the material arriving on the Ritigraben cone. There does not seem to exist a direct coupling between displacement rates of and sediment delivery by the rock-glacier body and the frequency of small- and medium-magnitude debris flows. In contrast, a direct link between source and sink processes clearly exists in the case of active-layer failures. In this case, failure processes at the rock-glacier snout and debris-flow events in the channel occur simultaneously and are both triggered by the rainfall event.},

  abstract = {The Himalayas represent the archetype of mountain building due to active continental collision and are considered in many studies as the locus of intense interactions between climate, denudation and tectonics. Estimates of modern denudation rates across the entire range remain, however, relatively sparse. In this study, in situ-produced cosmogenic 10Be concentrations were measured in detritic quartz in order to determine basin-scale denudation rates for the central part of the Himalayan range. River sand was sampled over several years in the main trans-Himalayan rivers, from the Himalayan front to the Ganga outlet in Bangladesh. The calculated 10Be denudation rates of the trans-Himalayan river basins range from 0.5 to 2.4mmyr−1 (average 1.3mmyr−1) and vary by up to a factor of 3 between sampling years. These denudation rates strongly contrast with the 0.007mmyr−1 denudation rate of southern tributary basins draining the Indian craton. This work also shows that in the Ganga basin, no systematic evolution of average 10Be concentrations is observed during floodplain transfer, implying that distal samples can be used to estimate the integrated denudation rate of the whole central Himalayan range. Samples from the Ganga in Bangladesh display remarkably low variability in 10Be concentration, implying an average Himalayan denudation rate of 1.0–1.1mmyr−1. However, within the floodplain, several samples suggest a recent perturbation of sediment transport dynamics with a recent increase in the relative sediment contribution from southern tributaries. The Himalayan sediment flux, deduced from the 10Be denudation rate of the range, is 610±230Mtyr−1. This flux is consistent, within uncertainty, with sediment fluxes derived from sediment gauging. The similarity of the two flux estimates suggests that Himalayan erosion fluxes have remained stable over the last centuries, even if the large uncertainties associated with each method hamper more precise assessments.},

  abstract = {How rock relief is developed by glacial erosion in alpine landscapes is a key question in understanding the controls on mountain range topography. Any generation of relief by glaciers at the highest elevations in mountain ranges can affect the distribution of precipitation in alpine landscapes, creating feedbacks between glacier mass balance and glacial erosion. Relief production at high-elevation mountain crests is addressed using a numerical model that incorporates glacier dynamics and subglacial erosion, as well as relevant hillslope processes. Blowing snow from a valley-bounding plateau, and avalanching onto the accumulation zone of the glacier is included in the model. Furthermore, temperature-dependent frost cracking is used as a proxy for headwall backwearing. The parameterization of subglacial erosion produces about 500 m of erosion over the 400 ka of each numerical simulation. In steady and varying climate scenarios, valley floors flatten as headwalls increase in height and retreat headward over time. Headwall slopes increase in simulations in which quarrying is explicitly incorporated; rates of quarrying are high near the base of the headwall, increasing headwall length and slope as a result of valley floor lowering. High rates of subglacial erosion and production of headwall relief also result when elastic flexural uplift occurs in response to mass unloading. Small overdeepenings form at the base of the headwall in steady-climate simulations, when the glacier is small at the end of the model run. While the final profiles are relatively insensitive to the erosion rule used, quarrying is most effective near the head of the glacier, whereas rates of abrasion reflect the instantaneous pattern of integrated ice discharge, or ice flux. In simulations in which cirques are formed, the equilibrium line altitude is hundreds of meters above the cirque floor; however, the time-averaged horizontal position of the equilibrium line corresponds well with the downvalley position of the cirques.},

However, their development, the link between their occurrence and the emplacement mechanisms of long runout landslides, and the necessity of a basal ice layer remain poorly understood. Here, we analyse the morphometry of longitudinal ridges of a martian landslide and show that the wavelength of the ridges is 2–3 times the average thickness of the landslide deposit, a unique scaling relationship previously reported in ice-free rapid granular flow experiments. We recognize en-echelon features that we interpret as kinematic indicators, congruent with experimentally-measured transverse velocity gradient. We suggest that longitudinal ridges should not be considered as unequivocal evidence for presence of ice, rather as inevitable features of rapid granular sliding material, that originate from a mechanical instability once a kinematic threshold is surpassed.},

They provide evidence of a rather unstable Holocene climate punctuated by 15 phases of higher lake-level: 11 250–11 050, 10 300–10 000, 9550–9150, 8300–8050, 7550–7250, 6350–5900, 5650–5200, 4850–4800, 4150–3950, 3500–3100, 2750–2350, 1800–1700, 1300–1100, 750–650 cal.

A comparison of this mid-European lake-level record with the GISP2-Polar Circulation Index (PCI) record, the North Atlantic ice-rafting debris (IRD) events and the 14C record suggests teleconnections in a complex cryosphere-ocean-atmosphere system. Correlations between the GISP2-PCI, the mid-European lakelevel, the North Atlantic IRD, and the residual 14C records, suggest that changes in the solar activity played a major role in Holocene climate oscillations over the North Atlantic area.},

  abstract = {Abstract. On the basis of a multi-proxy approach and a strategy combining lacustrine and marine records along a north–south transect, data collected in the central Mediterranean within the framework of a collaborative project have led to reconstruction of high-resolution and well-dated palaeohydrological records and to assessment of their spatial and temporal coherency. Contrasting patterns of palaeohydrological changes have been evidenced in the central Mediterranean: south (north) of around 40° N of latitude, the middle part of the Holocene was characterised by lake-level maxima (minima), during an interval dated to ca. 10 300–4500 cal BP to the south and 9000–4500 cal BP to the north. Available data suggest that these contrasting palaeohydrological patterns operated throughout the Holocene, both on millennial and centennial scales. Regarding precipitation seasonality, maximum humidity in the central Mediterranean during the middle part of the Holocene was characterised by humid winters and dry summers north of ca. 40° N, and humid winters and summers south of ca. 40° N. This may explain an apparent conflict between palaeoclimatic records depending on the proxies used for reconstruction as well as the synchronous expansion of tree species taxa with contrasting climatic requirements. In addition, south of ca. 40° N, the first millennium of the Holocene was characterised by very dry climatic conditions not only in the eastern, but also in the central- and the western Mediterranean zones as reflected by low lake levels and delayed reforestation. These results suggest that, in addition to the influence of the Nile discharge reinforced by the African monsoon, the deposition of Sapropel 1 has been favoured (1) by an increase in winter precipitation in the northern Mediterranean borderlands, and (2) by an increase in winter and summer precipitation in the southern Mediterranean area. The climate reversal following the Holocene climate optimum appears to have been punctuated by two major climate changes around 7500 and 4500 cal BP.  In the central Mediterranean, the Holocene palaeohydrological changes developed in response to a combination of orbital, ice-sheet and solar forcing factors. The maximum humidity interval in the south-central Mediterranean started ca. 10 300 cal BP, in correlation with the decline (1) of the possible blocking effects of the North Atlantic anticyclone linked to maximum insolation, and/or (2) of the influence of the remnant ice sheets and fresh water forcing in the North Atlantic Ocean. In the north-central Mediterranean, the lake-level minimum interval began only around 9000 cal BP when the Fennoscandian ice sheet disappeared and a prevailing positive NAO-(North Atlantic Oscillation) type circulation developed in the North Atlantic area. The major palaeohydrological oscillation around 4500–4000 cal BP may be a non-linear response to the gradual decrease in insolation, with additional key seasonal and interhemispheric changes. On a centennial scale, the successive climatic events which punctuated the entire Holocene in the central Mediterranean coincided with cooling events associated with deglacial outbursts in the North Atlantic area and decreases in solar activity during the interval 11 700–7000 cal BP, and to a possible combination of NAO-type circulation and solar forcing since ca. 7000 cal BP onwards. Thus, regarding the centennial-scale climatic oscillations, the Mediterranean Basin appears to have been strongly linked to the North Atlantic area and affected by solar activity over the entire Holocene.  In addition to model experiments, a better understanding of forcing factors and past atmospheric circulation patterns behind the Holocene palaeohydrological changes in the Mediterranean area will require further investigation to establish additional high-resolution and well-dated records in selected locations around the Mediterranean Basin and in adjacent regions. Special attention should be paid to greater precision in the reconstruction, on millennial and centennial timescales, of changes in the latitudinal location of the limit between the northern and southern palaeohydrological Mediterranean sectors, depending on (1) the intensity and/or characteristics of climatic periods/oscillations (e.g. Holocene thermal maximum versus Neoglacial, as well as, for instance, the 8.2 ka event versus the 4 ka event or the Little Ice Age); and (2) on varying geographical conditions from the western to the eastern Mediterranean areas (longitudinal gradients). Finally, on the basis of projects using strategically located study sites, there is a need to explore possible influences of other general atmospheric circulation patterns than NAO, such as the East Atlantic–West Russian or North Sea–Caspian patterns, in explaining the apparent complexity of palaeoclimatic (palaeohydrological) Holocene records from the Mediterranean area.},

  abstract = {Bleicher (2013) discussed interpretations proposed by Magny (2004) that Holocene lake-level fluctuations in west-central Europe suggest possible solar forcing of climate. He pointed out that the method used by Magny (2004) is a variant of a cumulative probability function (CPF) and cannot prove solar forcing of central European lake-level changes. He concluded that only few episodes of lake-level changes are climatically driven and that non-climatic factors were dominating. While Bleicher’s paper offers a stimulating contribution to the general debate on CPFs, the present comment is based on an approach which, in contrast to CPFs, excludes any consideration of variations in the probabilities over the time intervals given by calibration of 14C dates, as well as any distinction between types of dates (radiocarbon versus tree ring). It produces a revised pattern of the mid-European high lake-level events for the whole Holocene, supporting the hypothesis proposed in Magny (2004). Comparisons with other regional and North Atlantic palaeoclimatic records suggest that, without excluding other forcing factors, the successive high lake-level events recognised in west-central Europe reflect a combination of three main forcing factors acting on millennial and centennial scales, i.e. orbitally driven changes in insolation, impacts of deglacial outbursts and, possibly, variations in solar activity. Finally, it is clear that further investigations are still needed in order to improve the chronological data set for mid-European lake-level fluctuations, with particular attention to better defining the beginning and end of events.},

BP from sediment sequences of Lakes Accesa in Tuscany (north-central Italy) and Maliq (Albania) in the central Mediterranean. The available data make it possible to recognise a tripartite climatic oscillation between c. 4300–3800 cal. BP. A phase characterised by drier conditions at c. 4100–3950 cal. BP appears to have been bracketed by two phases marked by wetter conditions and dated to c. 4300–4100 and 3950–3850 cal. BP, respectively. The deposition of the Avellino tephra occurred during the first humid phase, slightly before 4300 cal. BP, and that of an interplinian tephra AP2-AP4 (or Pr1) around 4050 cal. BP during the dry intermediate phase. This dry median episode may be related to the so-called ‘4.2 ka event’ observed in tropical areas as well as in northwestern Italy. A comparison of the Accesa lake-level record with palaeoclimatic terrestrial and marine records suggests that this complex climatic oscillation around 4300–3800 cal. BP affected the central and western Mediterranean area. The key position of the 4300–3800 cal. BP climatic oscillation at a crucial transition from mid to late Holocene in the Mediterranean and tropical areas, deserves major consideration in further investigations.},

  abstract = {Exposure dating of abraded bedrock surfaces below glacial trimlines in the Pie˛ ciu Stawów Polskich/ Roztoki Valley, using cosmogenic 36Cl, has been applied to determine the deglaciation chronology in the study area. Nineteen rock samples yielded ages between 21.5 and 9.5 ka. The spatial distribution of ages provides evidence of progressive downwasting of glaciers within the study area. Dates of exposure indicate that the onset of ice volume decrease occurred no later than 21.5 ka. This provides evidence that the local maximum glaciation occurred in accordance with the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The first period of deglaciation in the study area was completed around 18 ka. Further significant loss of ice volume is confirmed between 15 and 13 ka. The spatial distribution of chronological data within the Pie˛ ciu Stawów Polskich Valley indicates post-LGM readvances of glaciers around 17 ka and 12 ka. Using the glacier modelling and paleoclimate proxies from the study area, the early Late Glacial glacier had been stable with a 9e10  C decrease in temperature and 30e50\% lower precipitation in relation to modern conditions. The subsequent advance took place with temperatures 6e7  C lower and 10e30\% less precipitation. The timing of the readvances is nearly synchronous with Late Glacial advances in the European Alps, Southern Carpathians and Anatolian peninsula. This suggests synchronicity of major climatic fluctuations across Central Europe and the northern margin of the Mediterranean Basin.},

Chlorine-36 exposure dating of moraine boulders suggests two major phases of moraine stabilization, at 26–21 ka (LGM I — maximum) and at 18 ka (LGM II). The dates suggest a significantly earlier maximum advance on the southern side of the range. Reconstructing the geometry of four glaciers in the Sucha Woda, Pańszczyca, Mlynicka and Velicka valleys allowed determining their equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) at 1460, 1460, 1650 and 1700 m asl, respectively. Based on a positive degree-day model, the mass balance and climatic parameter anomaly (temperature and precipitation) has been constrained for LGM I advance. Modeling results indicate slightly different conditions between northern and southern slopes. The N–S ELA gradient finds confirmation in slightly higher temperature (at least 1 °C) or lower precipitation (15\%) on the south-facing glaciers during LGM I. The precipitation distribution over the High Tatra Mountains indicates potentially different LGM atmospheric circulation than at the present day, with reduced northwesterly inflow and increased southerly and westerly inflows of moist air masses.},

  abstract = {Landslides are generally associated with a trigger, such as an earthquake, a rapid snowmelt or a large storm. The landslide event can include a single landslide or many thousands. The frequency–area (or volume) distribution of a landslide event quantifies the number of landslides that occur at different sizes. We examine three well-documented landslide events, from Italy, Guatemala and the USA, each with a different triggering mechanism, and find that the landslide areas for all three are well approximated by the same three-parameter inverse-gamma distribution. For small landslide areas this distribution has an exponential ‘roll-over’ and for medium and large landslide areas decays as a power-law with exponent −2·40. One implication of this landslide distribution is that the mean area of landslides in the distribution is independent of the size of the event. We also introduce a landslide-event magnitude scale mL = log(NLT), with NLT the total number of landslides associated with a trigger. If a landslide-event inventory is incomplete (i.e. smaller landslides are not included), the partial inventory can be compared with our landslide probability distribution, and the corresponding landslide-event magnitude inferred. This technique can be applied to inventories of historical landslides, inferring the total number of landslides that occurred over geologic time, and how many of these have been erased by erosion, vegetation, and human activity. We have also considered three rockfall-dominated inventories, and find that the frequency–size distributions differ substantially from those associated with other landslide types. We suggest that our proposed frequency–size distribution for landslides (excluding rockfalls) will be useful in quantifying the severity of landslide events and the contribution of landslides to erosion.

  abstract = {This paper relates landslide inventories to erosion rates and provides quantitative estimates of the landslide hazard associated with earthquakes. We do this by utilizing a three-parameter inverse-gamma distribution, which fits the frequency–area statistics of three substantially dcompleteT landslide-event inventories. A consequence of this general distribution is that a landslide-event magnitude mL=logNLT can be introduced, where NLT is the total number of landslides associated with the landslide event. Using this general distribution, landslide-event magnitudes mL can be obtained from incomplete landslide inventories, and the total area and volume of associated landslides, as well as the area and volume of the maximum landslides, can be directly related to the landslide-event magnitude. Using estimated recurrence intervals for three landslide events and the time span for two historical inventories, we estimate regional erosion rates associated with landslides as typically 0.1–2.5 mm yearÀ1. We next give an empirical correlation between the earthquake magnitude, associated landslideevent magnitude, and the total volume of associated landslides. Using these correlations, we estimate that the minimum earthquake magnitudes that will generate landslides is M=4.3F0.4. Finally, using Gutenberg–Richter frequency-magnitude statistics for regional seismicity, we relate the intensity of seismicity in an area and the magnitude of the largest regional earthquakes to erosion rates. We find that typical seismically induced erosion rates in active subduction zones are 0.2–7 mm yearÀ1 and adjacent to plate boundary strike-slip fault zones are 0.01–0.7 mm yearÀ1.},

  abstract = {Vegetation can play an important role in stabilizing soil against shallow landslides. Using a threedimensional (3D) finite element method, we developed a model to study the impact of different management scenarios on slope stability in mountain forests. Ground truth data were obtained from a mixed forest ecosystem situated at an altitude of 1400 m a.s.l. in the French Alps. Five scenarios representing the forest at different spatial and temporal stages of management were selected: [A] bare soil, [B] tree island (i.e. tree groups growing in clusters) on bare soil, [C] new gap (i.e. canopy free zones with little understorey) in homogeneous forest, [D] old gap (i.e. canopy free zones with abundant understorey) in homogeneous forest and [E] homogeneous forest. For scenarios [B], [C] and [D], the locations of the vegetated patch along the slope (top, centre and toe) were also tested, to determine if vegetation patterns influenced slope stability. As plant roots play a crucial role in reinforcing soil, we altered the 3D spatial distribution of root density in the model using real data. By calculating the factor of safety (FoS), i.e. a measure of the likelihood that the slope will fail, we show that slope morphology, including angle and soil depth, play an essential role in slope stability. Vegetation also exhibited a positive effect on slope stability, but the efficiency of this effect was significantly influenced by slope morphology and root distribution with regard to soil depth. In particular, if a layer of soil beneath the most superficial rooting zone contained few roots, slope integrity was compromised. Compared to bare soil, the FoS increase due to vegetation was only ≤0.2 (i.e. ≤15\%), when deeper soil layers contained few or no roots. However, if the soil profile contained roots throughout, the FoS increase was {$>$}25\% higher. We highlight the importance of taking into account spatial complexity and refining the output, i.e. FoS, during the modelling of slope stability, which can only be achieved through the use of 3D models.},

Patients with reducible AAD underwent direct posterior stabilization. All patients were treated with a four-drug antituberculosis therapy (ATT) regimen (10-20 mg/kg/day rifampicin, 10-20 mg/kg/day isoniazid, and 15 mg/kg/day ethambutol in a single daily dose; and pyrazinamide 20-35 mg/kg/day in two divided doses) for 3 months. The pyrazinamide was then discontinued after 3 months and the ethambutol after 1 year. The rifampicin and isoniazid were continued for 18 months.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Most of the patients had irreducible AAD. There was a high incidence of long tract signs, and the restriction of neck movements, as well as neck pain, was also very common. There was a significant delay in seeking neurosurgical consultation. Most patients were assigned poor preoperative grades, but they experienced excellent improvement postoperatively.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The presence of tubercular AAD in children can have subtle manifestations leading to delayed diagnosis. The successful management of tubercular AAD can be achieved after determining the extent of the disease process and the underlying instability. The goal of surgery is tissue diagnosis and relief of neural compression and stabilization. Medical treatment with ATT is an integral part of the treatment protocol.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We present an analytical, seismologically consistent expression for the surface area of the region within which most landslides triggered by an earthquake are located (landslide distribution area). This expression is based on scaling laws relating seismic moment, source depth, and focal mechanism with ground shaking and fault rupture length and assumes a globally constant threshold of acceleration for onset of systematic mass wasting. The seismological assumptions are identical to those recently used to propose a seismologically consistent expression for the total volume and area of landslides triggered by an earthquake. To test the accuracy of the model we gathered geophysical information and estimates of the landslide distribution area for 83 earthquakes. To reduce uncertainties and inconsistencies in the estimation of the landslide distribution area, we propose an objective definition based on the shortest distance from the seismic wave emission line containing 95\,\% of the total landslide area. Without any empirical calibration the model explains 56\,\% of the variance in our dataset, and predicts 35 to 49 out of 83 cases within a factor of 2, depending on how we account for uncertainties on the seismic source depth. For most cases with comprehensive landslide inventories we show that our prediction compares well with the smallest region around the fault containing 95\,\% of the total landslide area. Aspects ignored by the model that could explain the residuals include local variations of the threshold of acceleration and processes modulating the surface ground shaking, such as the distribution of seismic energy release on the fault plane, the dynamic stress drop, and rupture directivity. Nevertheless, its simplicity and first-order accuracy suggest that the model can yield plausible and useful estimates of the landslide distribution area in near-real time, with earthquake parameters issued by standard detection routines.},

  abstract = {Crevice-type caves, formed along joints, are very common in the Polish Flysch Carpathians (more than 600 have been recorded). The caves represent accessible parts of the widened cracks, which are basic, initial forms of development of deepseated rock landslides. Structural features of four selected caves (situated in different parts of the Carpathians) were studied in order to determine relations between joint systems and landslide formation. The studies prove that the main rock scarps often represent effects of earlier propagation of the cracks ( = cutting surfaces) due to loading and unloading shearing stress. The cracks are structural forms developed along joints or faults. The cutting surfaces represented by cracks (caves) develop a long time before the main gravitational mass movements, whereas the sliding surfaces (shearing zones) are formed or significantly modified ad hoc during the gravitational transport of rock masses. Occurrence of the deep initial cracks causes modification of shape of the sliding surfaces, which are noncircular. The mountain slopes cut by many cracks are permanently developed. Thus, the periodic increase of activity of external factors (floods, downpours, earthquakes, etc.) leads to common formation of the landslides earlier prepared by crack development. This model of slope evolution enables us to interpret the occurrence of the landslide phases (in the Holocene) during which increasing of frequency of the landslides is observed.},

  abstract = {Analysis of non-karst caves in the Flysch Carpathians confirms the connection between the tectonic evolution of this orogen and the initial phase of cave formation. The compressional-extensional regime during the tectonic stages of the evolution of the Carpathians is the foundation of subsequent gravitational stresses within the slopes, which brought about various deformations of rock massifs, producing diverse types of subsurface cavities – caves. Therefore, most caves that occur in the Carpathians, represent forms of the opening and widening of joints and stress zones originated much earlier. Classification based on the chronology and mechanisms of these caves is proposed. A chronological approach requires understanding the relationship of cave development to the stages of slope evolution and enables the construction of the morphogenetic classification, whereas consideration of the processes affecting the rock massif structure allows geomechanic classification. Using the morphogenetic criterion, three categories of caves can be distinguished: initial caves developed during slope deformations preceding the principal slope failures (landslides), subsequent caves formed during the main slope failure, and intermediate caves related to the main scarp formation. On the basis of the geomechanic criterion the following types of caves can be distinguished: dilational caves formed due to tensional fractures widening, dilatancy caves formed due to the fissure macrodilatancy, and boulder caves, which represent chaotic cavities. In order to illustrate this classification, type localities of the various cave types are presented. The radiocarbon dating of secondary formations (speleothems) occurring in the caves indicate that they initially formed in the Weichselian (Upper Plenivistulian), Late Glacial and Early Holocene and underwent various transformations.},

  abstract = {A unique artefact — the fragment of a bow made of yew wood, indicating the hunting activity of prehistoric man — was found within the sediments of the landslide peat bog (at the depth of 330 cm) formed on the Mt. Kamiennik (Polish Flysch Carpathians). The datings of this artefact using 14C method at ca 3790–3380 cal BC indicate its connection with the activity of the Neolithic man, related to the Funnel Beaker Culture. In the sequence of the peat bog deposits formed since the Atlantic Phase, the palaeoclimatic changes of the Middleand Late Holocene, as well as traces of human impact in these and subsequent periods were recorded and analysed using palynological, macrofossils, lithological methods, and dated with radiocarbon. Palaeoenvironmental changes identified in the peat horizon bearing the artefact were marked by the delivery of minerogenic, “high energy” deposits (with charcoal) to the peat bog, as well as distinct changes of plant communities. These phenomena confirm a significant human impact caused by the Prehistoric man on landslide areas. On the other hand, the study confirms significant importance of climatic condition for human activity and proves that landslide peat bog deposits are very sensitive records of palaeoenvironmental changes. The archaeological artefact essentially supplements the results of our interdisciplinary palaeoenvironmental study. It is one of the rare Neolithic bows found in the area of Europe, till now.},

  abstract = {Types of gravitational movements in the Flysch Carpathians are related to tectonic and lithologic anisotropy of rock massifs. This article presents the main types of mass movements in the highly anisotropic flysch massifs: lateral spreading and rock flow, topple, translational, rotational and compound sliding and complex type of mass movements, which are illustrated by chosen forms described using structural analysis (joints, faults and other structural planes orientation). Topple is the typical mass movement for double ridges and top trenches (e.g. Gaworzyna in the Beskid Sądecki Mts.). Translational landslides with flat, structural sliding surfaces typical for shallow forms can develop along bedding planes (e.g. Duszatyn, Western Bieszczady Mts.) as well as along joints (Łopuszna, Gorce Mts.) and fault planes (Rzeki, Gorce Mts.). Currently used classification of the “structural landslides” is applied only to translational landslides. Shearing zones of deep-seated landslides are composed of structural sections (of joints, faults, bedding planes) and shearing elements. Consequently, most of the Carpathian landslides have developed as compound type (with non-circular sliding zones) representing complex movements, combined with various types of displacement: rotation, translation and/or topple. Purely rotational movements with circular failure (typical for isotropic material) have developed in the flysch where thick-bedded, hard sandstones are underlain by plastic shales (e.g. Mt. Kostrza in the Beskid Wyspowy Mts.). The influence of anisotropy of these rocks on sliding surface is significantly reduced, and plastic-type rocks stimulate rock flow development, which is usually later transformed into complex landslides with predominant rotational movement (e.g. rotational landslide with topple and flow elements on Mt. Muronka in the Beskid Śląski Mts.). Compound landsliding on Mt. Luboń Wielki (Beskid Wyspowy Mts.) represents an antithetic rotational slide with topple- and rotational-type movements.},

Their geomorphological surface expression, especially when related to the effects of lithostructural control in sedimentary stratified bedrocks, is well characterized in theory, but sometimes not as well documented in field cases. In this contribution the investigation of several DSGSDs in the area of the Northern Apennines of Italy is reported. A survey of the area was conducted using fast and low-cost satellite imaging techniques, in order to describe the surface features of selected DSGSDs and verify how their occurrence is linked to the effect of lithostructural constrains such as bedding and folding. Surface features developed in parallel to the strike of the slope are mostly related to the main gravitative strain acting on the deformation. Features along slope dip are instead formed by the release of tension caused by compressive forces at the landslide foot or by the presence of pre-existing weak lines. One example of a DSGSD, formed on the hinge of a vertical fold, shows a corrugated appearance due to the release of vertical fractures that mask most other features usually associated with DSGSDs. This potentially impairs the detection of these landforms during field and remote surveys.},

  abstract = {Use of the geological strength index (GSI) rock mass classification system and the associated m, s and a parameter relationships linking GSI with the Hoek–Brown failure criterion provides a demonstrated, effective and reliable approach for prediction of rock mass strength for surface and underground excavation design and for rock support selection for most “normal” rock masses. One of the key advantages of the index is that it allows characterization of rock masses difficult to describe, such as flysch, and the geological reasoning it embodies, allowing adjustments to be made to its ratings to cover a wide range of rock masses and conditions compared to a typical engineering approach. Flysch, having high heterogeneity in its petrographic nature and a tectonically disturbed structure, forms very weak rock masses in many cases and needs a particular geotechnical classification according to the engineering geological characteristics it presents. After a decade of application of the GSI for the classification of heterogeneous rock masses (Marinos and Hoek 2001), this paper attempts to re-evaluate or verify the original values and to contribute to the appropriate selection of the index for various conditions. A revised GSI diagram for heterogeneous rock masses, such as flysch, is presented, where a certain range of GSI values for every rock mass type is proposed according to the siltstone-sandstone participation and their tectonic disturbance. Data from the design and construction of a large number of tunnels in a variety of geological conditions were assessed for this purpose. In addition to the GSI values, the selection of the appropriate “intact” rock properties for this type of heterogeneous rock mass is also discussed, where characteristic σci, Ei and modulus ratio (MR) values are proposed.},

  abstract = {The NW-SE striking Mýto-Tisovec map-scale brittle fault distinctively affects the internal zones of the Western Carpathians. It cuts and evidently offsets Meso-Alpine tectonic units and structures and represents a zone of important geophysical anomalies as well. Using methods of structural analysis, the complex tectonic evolution of this long living fault has been restored. Six successive fault-slip related regional paleostress events, controlling the activity of the MýtoTisovec fault have been distinguished. The oldest recognized paleostress event, with NNE-SSW maximum principal stress axis operated after the Late Cretaceous and before the Middle Eocene. The orientation of the Miocene maximum principal stress axis rotated clockwise from NW-SE in the Early Miocene to a NE-SW direction in the Middle Miocene and E-W direction in the Late Miocene—Pliocene. NNW-SSE trending compression has been estimated for the Quaternary stress field. Correspondingly, three periods of Miocene tensional paleostress events with NE-SW, NW-SE and N-S orientation of minimum principal stress axis has been restored as well. The Mýto-Tisovec fault kinematically fluctuated in the changing paleostress field. However, the most evident structural records are related to the dominant dextral strikeslip regime. Dextral transtensional tectonic regime was responsible also for opening of a narrow and deep depositional depression – the Brezno Basin, related to the Mýto-Tisovec fault, where the Late Eocene—Early Miocene sediments of the Central Carpathian Paleogene Basin (CCPB) fill have been deposited and later preserved.},

In this study, regional distribution analyses have been coupled with local detailed geological and geomorphological surveys of individual phenomena to detect the controlling factors, deformation processes and evolution stages of DSGSD. Data and maps from field and remote-sensing investigations have been supported by drill data and geomechanical and hydrogeochemical analyses from project studies for hydroelectric plants and tunnels. Several phenomena related to DSGSD have been studied thoroughly: gravity-induced stresses, tectonic– metamorphic setting, morphostructural relations, glacial and periglacial morphodynamics, recent tectonic evolution, hydrogeological conditions and karst phenomena have been generically indicated as controlling factors. In the studied area three of the controlling factors were crucial in differentiating the form and evolution of DSGSDs: deep dissolution, surface tectonics, and tectonostructural setting. They are presented as possible end members of a classification scheme for DSGSDs.},

A close relationship exists between differential slope evolution, structural setting, and slope attitude.

  abstract = {Rates and processes of frost weathering in the Alps were investigated by visual observations of intensively shattered rocks, continuous monitoring of frost wedging and rock temperatures in bedrock and measurements of rockfall activity. Rapid frost weathering of hard-intact rocks occurs along lakes and streams where seasonal freezing promotes ice segregation in the rock. Otherwise, rocks require pre-existing weakness or a long exposure period for intensively shattered. Automated monitoring shows that crack opening occurs at three scales, including small opening accompanying short-term frost cycles, slightly larger movements during seasonal freezing and occasional large opening originating from refreezing of snow-melt water during seasonal thawing. The opening events require at least partial water saturation in the crack. The repetition of crack opening (frost wedging) results in permanent opening and finally debris dislocation. Debris collections below fractured rockwalls show that pebble falls occur at an average rate of about 0.1 mm a−1 with significant spatial and inter-annual variations. Occasional large boulder falls significantly raise the rockwall erosion rates, controlled by such factors as the joint distribution in the bedrock, repetition of annual freeze–thaw cycles and extraordinary summer thaw.},

Near-surface rock temperature was also monitored on the cirque wall. Maximum rockfall activity occurs on average about 10 days after the meltout of the cirque wall. The intensive activity is rarely associated with precipitation events or diurnal frost cycles on the rockface. A thermal conduction model suggests that rockfalls at this site occur most frequently when the seasonal thawing front penetrates to a depth of about 1 m in the bedrock. While the freeze–thaw penetration controls the maximum dimensions of detachable rock mass, joint spacing on the rockface affects the size distribution of rockfall debris. Boulder falls resulting from seasonal frost weathering are considered to be the most important process responsible for the contemporary modification of the cirque wall. The rockfall volume during a thawing period is usually 1–3 m3, which is equivalent to the rate of cirque wall retreat of the order of 0.01 mm yeary1. However, big boulder falls that occur once per decade can increase the retreat rate significantly. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Field data on the rates of solifluction and associated parameters are compiled from the literature, in an attempt to evaluate factors controlling the spatial variability in solifluction processes and landforms, with special attention on the climate–solifluction relationship. The analyzed data originate from 46 sites over a wide range of periglacial environments, from Antarctic nunataks to tropical high mountains. Solifluction, broadly defined as slow mass wasting resulting from freeze–thaw action in fine-textured soils, involves several components: needle ice creep and diurnal frost creep originating from diurnal freeze–thaw action; annual frost creep, gelifluction and plug-like flow originating from annual freeze–thaw action; and retrograde movement caused by soil cohesion. The depth and thickness of ice lenses and freeze–thaw frequency are the major controls on the spatial variation in solifluction processes. Near the warm margin of the solifluction-affected environment, diurnal freeze–thaw action induces shallow but relatively rapid movement of a superficial layer 5–10 cm thick on average, often creating the thin stone-banked lobes typically seen on tropical high mountains. In addition to diurnal movement, annual frost creep and gelifluction may occur on slopes with soil climates of seasonal frost to warm permafrost, dislocating a soil layer shallower than 60 cm at a rate of centimeters per year and eventually producing medium-size solifluction lobes. In High-Arctic cold permafrost regions, two-sided freezing can induce plug-like flow of a soil mass 60 cm or thicker. The correlation between process and landform suggests that the riser height of lobes is indicative of the maximum depth of movement and prevailing freeze–thaw type. Climate change may result in new different ground freezing conditions, thereby influencing the surface velocity and maximum depth of soil movement. Soil moisture and topography also control solifluction. High moisture availability in the seasonal freezing period enhances diurnal freeze–thaw action and subsequent seasonal frost heaving. The latter contributes to raising the moisture content of the thawed layer and promotes gelifluction during the thawing period. The slope angle defines the upper limit of the surface velocity of solifluction. A diagram correlating the potential frost creep with the actual surface velocity permits an inter-site comparison of the relative magnitude of solifluction components. Physically based modelling of periglacial slope evolution requires synthetic and more detailed field monitoring and laboratory simulations of solifluction processes. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Pronival (protalus) ramparts at three sites in southern Norway—Smørbotn, Alnesreset and Nystølsnovi—are assessed in relation to evidence of snow-avalanche activity, and dated using Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD). The position of each rampart suggests frequent snow avalanches played a major role in rampart formation. The pronival ramparts at Smørbotn and Nystølsnovi are characterized by a high proportion of unweathered, very angular clasts, many clean boulders (without any lichen or moss cover), steep distal slope angles, and a disturbed ground cover of vegetation with characteristic alpine pioneer plant species on crests and proximal slopes. High Schmidt-hammer R-values (mean 56.2–58.5) yielded SHD ages of b 2900 years and b 1550 years, respectively. These ramparts are currently active and have probably developed since the early Holocene under environmental conditions similar to those at present. Pronival ramparts at Alnesreset are characterized by highly weathered, mainly angular boulders (virtually none of which is clean), a mature, undisturbed vegetation cover, and lower distal slope angles. Mean R-values of 39.9–40.3 from these ramparts yielded SHD ages within the range 9450 to 14,650 years (with 95\% certainty), indicating formation during the Younger Dryas Stadial and relict status for most of the Holocene. Our results: (1) show that rockfall is not the only primary process involved in the formation of pronival ramparts; (2) broaden the range of landforms included in snow-avalanche geomorphology; (3) demonstrate the feasibility of dating pronival ramparts; and (4) indicate their potential in palaeoenvironmental reconstruction.},

  abstract = {We present a new gridded climate reconstruction for Europe for the last 12,000 years based on pollen data. The reconstruction is an update of Davis et al. (2003) using the same methodology, but with a greatly expanded fossil and surface-sample dataset and more rigorous quality-control. The modern pollen dataset has been increased by more than 80\%, and the fossil pollen dataset by more than 50\%, representing almost 60,000 individual pollen samples. The climate parameters reconstructed include summer/winter and annual temperatures and precipitation, as well as a measure of moisture balance, and growing degree-days above 5  C. Confidence limits were established for the reconstruction based on transfer function and interpolation uncertainties. The reconstruction takes account of post-glacial isostatic readjustment which resulted in a potential warming bias of up to þ1e2  C for parts of Fennoscandia in the early Holocene, as well as changes in palaeogeography resulting from decaying ice sheets and rising post-glacial sea-levels. This new dataset has been evaluated against previously published independent quantitative climate reconstructions from a variety of archives on a site-by-site basis across Europe. The results of this comparison are generally very good; only chironomid-based reconstructions showed substantial differences with our values. Our reconstruction is available for download as gridded maps throughout the Holocene on a 1000-year time-step. The gridded format makes our reconstructions suitable for comparison with climate model output and for other applications such as vegetation and land-use modelling. Our new climate reconstruction suggests that warming in Europe during the mid-Holocene was greater in winter than in summer, an apparent paradox that is not consistent with current climate model simulations and traditional interpretations of Milankovitch theory.},

  abstract = {A fundamental yet unresolved question in fluvial geomorphology is what controls the width of valleys in mountainous terrain. Establishing a predictive relation for valley floor width is critical for realizing links between aquatic ecology and geomorphology because the most productive riverine habitats often occur in low-gradient streams with broad floodplains. Working in the Oregon Coast Range (western United States), we used airborne lidar to explore controls on valley width, and couple these findings with models of salmon habitat potential. We defined how valley floor width varies with drainage area in a catchment that exhibits relatively uniform ridge-and-valley topography sculpted by shallow landslides and debris flows. In drainage areas {$>$}0.1 km2, valley width increases as a power law function of drainage area with an exponent of \textasciitilde 0.6. Consequently, valley width increases more rapidly downstream than channel width (exponent of \textasciitilde 0.4), as derived by local hydraulic geometry. We used this baseline valley width–drainage area function to determine how ancient deep-seated landslides in a nearby catchment influence valley width. Anomalously wide valleys tend to occur upstream of, and adjacent to, large landslides, while downstream valley segments are narrower than predicted from our baseline relation. According to coho salmon habitat-potential models, broad valley segments associated with deep-seated landsliding resulted in a greater proportion of the channel network hosting productive habitat. Because large landslides in this area are structurally controlled, our findings indicate a strong link between geologic properties and aquatic habitat.},

  abstract = {Slopes undergoing deep-seated gravitational deformation create surface landforms that, if trenched and dated, yield critical data on slope kinematics. The northern slope of Pic d'Encampadana descends steeply 800\,m down into the glaciated Valira d'Orient of Andorra and has long been known for its numerous antislope scarps (sackungen), indicative of deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD). We excavated three trenches across antislope scarps and their adjacent troughs to date the deformation structures and to infer slope kinematics. Trough deposits have been disrupted by normal and reverse faulting, with the largest fault zone underlying the antislope scarp and dipping into the slope at 40°-80°. Trenches in the troughs expose fining-upward sequences of strata from which we interpret several cycles of: (1) episodic downdropping along graben faults and deepening of the topographic trough, (2) filling the trough with marginal colluvial and axial sag-pond sediments, followed by (3) a hiatus of soil profile development. The average time between deformation events in any one trench in the past 12–15\,ka is about 3–3.5\,ka. Deformation seems to have begun first in the lower part of the northern slope (1935\,m elevation) about 15.3\,ka, and had spread to the upper parts of the slope (2320\,m) by 11.6\,ka. Deformation in the lower slope ceased after 5.5\,ka, but continued higher on the slope into the mid-late Holocene. The youngest deformation dated (1.4–1.6\,ka) occurred in the highest trench on the slope. This pattern of younger deformation with increasing elevation has been documented at several other sites and has been ascribed to an upslope-migrating extensional stress field which originated at the base of the slope from glacial oversteepening and end-glacial debuttressing.},

At such locations, it is important to investigate the fault zone in sufficient detail to understand how displacements are accommodated on individual fault strands. At a site along a northern section of the Alpine fault zone on the South Island of New Zealand, surface mapping of a series of faulted river terraces and channels has revealed a complicated and poorly understood paleoearthquake history. We have acquired high-resolution 2- and 3-D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data over a large area (\textasciitilde 500×500m) of the terraces to map along-strike changes in shallow ({$<$}20m) fault zone morphology. By identifying distinct reflection patterns within the topographically migrated 3-D GPR volumes and extrapolating them to the longer and more widely spaced GPR profiles, we determined the subsurface extent of two main structural/depositional facies that were juxtaposed by three left-stepping en-echelon fault strands. Two regions of warped strata are interpreted to result from transpressive folding between the overlapping strands, where displacement is transferred from one fault to the next. We suggest that diffuse deformation between the overlapping fault tips results in anomalously low estimates for horizontal and vertical fault displacements of some geomorphic features.},

Assessing landslide causes is useful for hazard analysis, mitigation of slope instability, and for considering the role of landslides in landscape systems and evolution. Geological and geomorphological conditions (e.g., material type, strength and structure, and slope angle) predispose slopes to failure; knowledge of these conditions can help to predict the location, types, and volumes of potential failures. Determining when a slope will fail is a considerably more difficult challenge, largely due to the difficulty of observing or predicting the processes of material strength degradation. This chapter describes concepts of stability and explores some of the major causes and triggers of slope failure and opportunities for further research.},

A variety of tools and methods have been developed for these purposes, ranging from simple empirical–statistical correlations to advanced three-dimensional computer models. This paper provides an overview of the tools and methods that are currently available and discusses some of the main challenges that are currently being addressed by researchers, including the need for better guidance in the selection of model input parameter values, the challenge of translating model results into vulnerability estimates, the problem with too much initial spreading in the simulation of certain types of landslides, the challenge of accounting for sudden channel obstructions in the simulation of debris flows, and the sensitivity of models to topographic resolution and filtering methods.},

  abstract = {Runout analysis, the prediction of landslide motion and its effects, is an essential component of landslide risk assessment. A new continuum dynamic model has been developed for the runout analysis of extremely rapid, flow-like landslides, including rock avalanches, debris avalanches, debris flows and flow slides. The new model, DAN3D, is a 3D extension of the existing 2D model DAN. It uses a meshless, Lagrangian numerical method adapted from Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics to discretize and solve the depth-averaged equations of motion for an "equivalent fluid", a hypothetical material governed by simple rheological relationships. The required rheological parameters, rather than measured, are calibrated through back-analysis of real landslide case studies. The key capabilities of the model include: 1) the ability to simulate motion across complex 3D terrain without the need to input a pre-defined path direction or width and without introducing problems due to mesh distortion; 2) the ability to simulate strain-dependent, non-hydrostatic, anisotropic internal stresses due to 3D deformation of material with internal shear strength; 3) the ability to simulate mass and momentum transfer due to entrainment of path material; 4) the ability to simulate variations in rheology along the path and within the landslide; and 5) efficient and simple operation. The model outputs the simulated spatial distribution of hazard intensity parameters, including flow velocity and depth, which are required for delineating the potential impact area, estimating the vulnerability of elements within this area and designing protective measures. It has been tested using both analytical and experimental methods, and its general behaviour has been demonstrated using a series of simple parametric analyses. The model has also been applied at full-scale to the simulation of a wide variety of landslide types. These back-analyses form the basis for a more thorough calibration, but some useful patterns have already emerged. This experience has been applied in practice to landslide runout prediction, although so far only in a parametric way.

  abstract = {The recent warming in the Arctic is affecting a broad spectrum of physical, ecological, and human/cultural systems that may be irreversible on century time scales and have the potential to cause rapid changes in the earth system. The response of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to changes in climate is a major issue of global concern, yet there has not been a comprehensive review of the status of the contemporary carbon cycle of the Arctic and its response to climate change. This review is designed to clarify key uncertainties and vulnerabilities in the response of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to ongoing climatic change. While it is clear that there are substantial stocks of carbon in the Arctic, there are also significant uncertainties associated with the magnitude of organic matter stocks contained in permafrost and the storage of methane hydrates beneath both subterranean and submerged permafrost of the Arctic. In the context of the global carbon cycle, this review demonstrates that the Arctic plays an important role in the global dynamics of both CO2 and CH4. Studies suggest that the Arctic has been a sink for atmospheric CO2 of between 0 and 0.8 Pg C/yr in recent decades, which is between 0\% and 25\% of the global net land/ocean flux during the 1990s. The Arctic is a substantial source of CH4 to the atmosphere (between 32 and 112 Tg CH4/yr), primarily because of the large area of wetlands throughout the region. Analyses to date indicate that the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the Arctic during the remainder of the 21st century is highly uncertain. To improve the capability to assess the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to projected climate change, we recommend that (1) integrated regional studies be conducted to link observations of carbon dynamics to the processes that are likely to influence those dynamics, and (2) the understanding gained from these integrated studies be incorporated into both uncoupled and fully coupled carbon–climate modeling efforts.},

  abstract = {A map of extant slope failures is the most basic element of any landslide assessment. Without an accurate inventory of slope instability, it is not possible to analyze the controls on the spatial and temporal patterns of mass movement or the environmental, human, or geomorphic consequences of slides. Landslide inventory maps are tedious to compile, difficult to make in vegetated terrain using conventional techniques, and tend to be subjective. In addition, most landslide inventories simply outline landslide boundaries and do not offer information about landslide mechanics as manifested by internal deformation features. In an alternative approach, we constructed accurate, high-resolution DEMs from airborne laser altimetry (LIDAR) data to characterize a large landslide complex and surrounding terrain near Christchurch, New Zealand. One-dimensional, circular (2-D) and spherical (3-D) statistics are used to map the local topographic roughness in the DEMs over a spatial scale of 1.5 to 10 m. The bedrock landslide is rougher than adjacent unfailed terrain and any of the statistics can be employed to automatically detect and map the overall slide complex. Furthermore, statistics that include a measure of the local variability of aspect successfully delineate four kinematic units within the gently sloping lower half of the slide. Features with a minimum size of surface folds that have a wavelength of about 11 to 12 m and amplitude of about 1 m are readily mapped. Two adjacent earthflows within the landslide complex are distinguished by a contrast in median roughness, and texture and continuity of roughness elements. The less active of the earthflows has a surface morphology that presumably has been smoothed by surface processes. The Laplacian operator also accurately maps the kinematic units and the folds and longitudinal levees within and at the margins of the units. Finally, two-dimensional power spectra analyses are used to quantify how roughness varies with length scale. These results indicate that no dominant length scale of roughness exists for smooth, unfailed terrain. In contrast, zones with different styles of landslide deformation exhibit distinctive spectral peaks that correspond to the scale of deformation features, such as the compression folds. The topographic-based analyses described here may be used to objectively delineate landslide features, generate mechanical inferences about landslide behavior, and evaluate relatively the recent activity of slides.},

  abstract = {Landslides are treacherous, but risk management actions based on improved prediction of landslide runout can reduce casualties and damage. Forty rapid flow-like landslides of variable volume, entrainment, and composition are used to develop a volume-runout regression, which is compared to those established in previous research.  The cases are  analyzed to identify the most critical characteristics observable prior to failure which differentiate between events of high and low mobility. Mitigating long-runout flow-like landslides requires accurate hazard mapping, a task best accomplished through runout modelling. Current practice requires back-analyzing a set of cases consistent in scope with the target event, then applying the same rheology and parameters to forward modelling. This thesis determines which aspects of scope are most important to prioritize when selecting similar cases, as volume, movement type, morphology, and material have a more substantial influence on mobility than other physical characteristics. Statistical analysis of the performance of frictional and Voellmy rheologies over a range of parameters for the forty case studies provides the expected mean normalized runout and associated standard deviation, and recommendations for parameters to use in initial forward modelling of prospective events.},

  abstract = {The Tararua Range is located in the southern part of the North Island, New Zealand. It contains a large number of ridges with geomorphic features typically associated with deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD). The bedrock in the study area consists of alternating sandstone and mudstone beds that are highly folded and contain a large number of faults. The key components of this study included: the compilation of an inventory of DSGSD features within the Tararua Range and the characterisation of the rock mass and geomorphology of selected field sites. The results of the fieldwork along with the data from laboratory index testing on collected rock samples where used to conduct kinematic and finite element analyses. These analyses assessed potential factors influencing the stability and deformability of slopes within the study area. Over thirty DSGSD features were recognised in the Tararua Range (*440 km2) with a number of different surface geomorphic expressions. Field investigation was conducted at selected sites with very well developed geomorphic expression (10–20 m high scarps). The rock mass quality at these sites was estimated using the Geologic Strength Index (GSI). The overall rock mass was very blocky to blocky/disturbed/seamy with good to fair surface conditions, yielding GSI values between 30 and 55. Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) estimates of the sandstone using the point load test yielded values between 90 and 150 MPa. Both the sandstone and mudstone lithologies were found to have a high resistance to slaking. Kinematic analyses indicated that while structurally controlled failure mechanisms were feasible along a limited number of discontinuities, they could not satisfactorily explain the formation of the geomorphic features observed. Finite element numerical models were generated incorporating a range of rock mass strength values based on field and laboratory observations, along with site-specific discontinuity set orientations. In all modelled cases, the calculated critical strength reduction factor was {$>$}1, suggesting that catastrophic failure is unlikely without external triggering forces. The results of the numerical modelling also suggest that a combination rock mass strength and favourable localised discontinuity set orientation is controlling the deformation of the rock mass that lead to the DSGSD features.},

  abstract = {Estimation of landslide erosion rates and hazard prediction require a firm understanding of the physical controls on landslide size. In this study we seek to understand how the characteristics of different landscapes and forcing events influence the distribution of landslide size at a regional scale. We explore the parameter space of a mechanically-based landslide model through a series of simulations using digital elevation data. Consistent with previous studies, we find that large slope failures are infrequent due to the scarcity of large, steep hillslopes in typical mountainous topography. On the other hand, we find that the occurrence of small landslides is limited by the cohesive strength of hillslope material, which overcomes the weaker driving forces on short slopes. We test our model results with an empirical investigation of frequency-size distributions for eight real co-seismic landslide inventories. Although empirical data are noisy, we find a positive correlation between landslide size and hillslope relief, while the effects of PGA on landslide size are less pronounced. We conclude that landslide size distributions reflect the available distribution of hillslope geometries in a given landscape, and that external forcing (e.g., seismic ground motion) determines which subset of the hillslope distribution fails during a particular event. For a given landscape and forcing event, there is a particular length-scale over which landsliding is statistically favored, leading to the concept of characteristic landslide size distributions.},

  abstract = {We present a technique to produce spatially distributed ®elds of geometric alignment between topography and the orientation of geologic bedding planes (topographic/bedding-plane intersection angle). Computation and digital mapping of the topographic/bedding-plane intersection angle (TOBIA) requires the derivation of four spatially distributed variables: topographic slope, slope aspect, bedding dip, and dip azimuth. Slope and slope aspect surfaces are derived from a high resolution (10 m) digital elevation model. Ordinary kriging is used to interpolate spatially continuous ®elds of dip azimuth and dip from point measurements of strike and dip. Using these variables, TOBIA can be mapped either categorically as slope types, or as a continuous index. Categorical mapping requires two steps. First, slopes are classi®ed into three functional types based on the alignment between the dip azimuth and slope aspect. Slopes are then further partitioned based on the alignment between slope angle and dip angle. Continuous computations of TOBIA rely on a geometric equation using all four variables. The methods provide an ecient means for estimating topographic/bedding plane intersection angles over large areas. Resulting surfaces are useful for a variety of landscape-scale modeling applications, such as the prediction of potential hillslope failure, hydrologic ¯ow paths, and vegetation patterns. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {The Cenozoic history of the western Ogaden region of Ethiopia, between the Ethiopian rift and the South Afar margin, is marked by uplift and incision of the Ogaden plateau down to the Gorrahei Formation, an upper Cretaceous evaporite formation. Debuttressing of this and the overlying sedimentary formations resulted in widespread and spectacular gravitational spreading landforms over a minimum surface area of 15,000km2, most of which remains unstudied. After clearing up some misconceptions about the surface geology of the study area, the Kebenawa Ridge in the Audo Range, observations are reported that point to a tectonic style controlled by halokinesis and subsequently, gravitational spreading. The role of diapirism and karstification in the observed halokinesis is discussed, as well as the influence of halokinesis on gravitational spreading. Spreading is in part akin to sackung, in that ridge deformation features include a crestal graben and basal ridge topography extrusion, and deformation was triggered by lateral ridge debuttressing. Ridge spreading also presents analogy with gravitational spreading of the Canyonlands grabens in the Needles District, Canyonlands National Park, Utah. The scale and the mechanisms are found to be basically similar, but two differences are noted. First, incision by the drainage network in response to plateau uplift in Ethiopia has debuttressed the topography along two parallel rivers, instead of a single river (the Colorado River) in Utah. Secondly, incision proceeded to the base of the evaporite layer in the Ogaden, whereas incision has not exceeded the top of the evaporite layer in Utah. These differences may have influenced the details of the spreading mechanisms in ways that remain to be investigated. Overall, in Ethiopia, association of halokinesis and a transitional mode of gravitational spreading at the interface between narrow ridge spreading (sackung) and plateau spreading (Canyonlands-type), illustrates a fascinating and unusual ridge evolution style. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We used a coupled hydrological-stability model to study the hydrological control on shallow landslides in different precipitation regimes, with reference to the case study of Otta, located in central east Norway. We included a wide range of climatic settings, taking intensity, duration of the extreme events and two different antecedent precipitation conditions into account. Eleven future scenarios were determined using results of down-scaled meteorological models. Considering the uncertainty in the soil parameters, we used the Monte Carlo approach and probability of failure resulting from 5,000 trials was calculated for each precipitation scenario. In unstable areas the probabilities of failure at present and future conditions were compared using a bootstrapping method. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to understand how variations in input parameters influence the output of the selected model. The results show changes in the modelled stability conditions only if the effect of antecedent precipitation is not taken into account. The uncertainties in the predicted extreme precipitation events, soil parameters, and antecedent precipitation conditions do not allow any accurate estimation of changes in stability conditions for shallow landslides.},

Well-dated glacial chronologies from the southern mid-latitudes can inform on the synchronicity of glacial advances worldwide and provide insight on the drivers of southern hemisphere glaciations. In central Patagonia, two large outlet lobes of the former Patagonian Ice Sheet advanced in broad synchrony with the global LGM. In contrast to other parts of Patagonia, there is no convincing evidence for a more extensive local LGM advance during Marine Isotope Stage 3. Deglaciation initiated at ca. 19 ka, earlier than in other parts of Patagonia and regionally in the Southern Hemisphere, and rapid deglaciation saw ice margins retreat in places by at least 80-120 km within a few millennia. The Lateglacial glacier margins are poorly constrained, but an ice mass substantial enough to maintain a large regional proglacial lake must have persisted at this time. The timing of lake drainage and opening of the Río Baker drainage route to the Pacific Ocean is debated; the only directly dated shoreline suggests this occurred at the end of the Antarctic Cold Reversal at 12.7 ka. Palaeoecological evidence for cooling during the Antarctic Cold Reversal or Younger Dryas remains equivocal, which may reflect both the eurythermic nature of Patagonian vegetation and shifting Southern Westerly Winds. Eastern outlet glaciers appear to have advanced or stabilised at the Lateglacial/Holocene transition when palaeoenvironmental records indicate warmer and drier conditions, but the reason for this is unclear. Our review reveals both spatial and temporal gaps in available data that provide avenues for future research.},

The glacial phases in the Bohemian Forest occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum around 24.1 Æ 2.5, 23.6 Æ 2.4, 21.8 Æ 2.0 and 19.5 Æ 2.1 ka. Following phases of local glaciation occurred during the Northern Hemisphere deglaciation period around 16 ka and 14 ka. The last indicated phase may correlate with Older Dryas.

The limestone rocks have been radiochemically treated to isolate and determine long-lived 36Cl by accelerator mass spectrometry. It could be shown that the Veliki vrh rock avalanche from the Košuta Mountain (Slovenia) event can be very likely linked to one of the major historical earthquakes in Europe happening on the 25th of January 1348. Taken into account independently determined denudation rates, inherited 36Cl originating from pre-exposure at shallow depths (20–55~m) could be calculated. The high amount of inherited 36Cl, i.e. 17–46\% of the total 36Cl, makes this site not suitable for a precise determination of the 36Cl production rate as it was originally anticipated. Veliki vrh is a “classic” rock avalanche of high velocity. The slope failed in the upper part with a translational slide predominantly along the bedding planes, whereas dynamic fragmentation is the cause for further crushing of the material and the long runout.},

This version of the magnitude is of great interest as it can be used as a more accurate replacement for ML. To-day the moment magnitude Mw is the magnitude that is used particularly for large earthquakes and unlike ML, it does not saturate. In this paper, it is shown that the theoretical “ratio” between the moment magnitude Mw and Me and therefore Mw and ML for an individual earthquake can be determined directly from the earthquake fault aspect ratio β using the equation Mw/Me\,=\,p where p\,=\,2/3 (1\,+\,β). In general, since β can vary mathematically from 0 to 1, the corresponding values of the ratio Mw/Me will vary within a limited range (2/3 to 4/3). These variations can account for much of the large scatter of points on observed (Mw, ML) plots. It is also shown that both the apparent stress σa and the corner frequency fc are simple functions of the aspect ratio and magnitude and that these relations have important implications to the self-similar problem. The results of an analysis of 3454 earthquakes from the eastern Mediterranean seismic zone are presented which support the theoretical relations reviewed in this paper.},

In contrast to most existing computational tools, r.avaflow (i) employs a two-phase, interacting solid and fluid mixture model (Pudasaini, 2012); (ii) is suitable for modelling more or less complex process chains and interactions; (iii) explicitly considers both entrainment and stopping with deposition, i.e. the change of the basal topography; (iv) allows for the definition of multiple release masses, and/or hydrographs; and (v) serves with built-in functionalities for validation, parameter optimization, and sensitivity analysis. r.avaflow is freely available as a raster module of the GRASS GIS software, employing the programming languages Python and C along with the statistical software R. We exemplify the functionalities of r.avaflow by means of two sets of computational experiments: (1) generic process chains consisting in bulk mass and hydrograph release into a reservoir with entrainment of the dam and impact downstream; (2) the prehistoric Acheron rock avalanche, New Zealand. The simulation results are generally plausible for (1) and, after the optimization of two key parameters, reasonably in line with the corresponding observations for (2). However, we identify some potential to enhance the analytic and numerical concepts. Further, thorough parameter studies will be necessary in order to make r.avaflow fit for reliable forward simulations of possible future mass flow events.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Natural hazards like landslides, avalanches, floods and debris flows can result in enormous property damage and human casualties in mountainous regions. Switzerland has always been exposed to a wide variety of natural hazards mostly located in its alpine valleys. Recent natural disasters comprising avalanches, floods, debris flows and slope instabilities led to substantial loss of life and damage to property, infrastructure, cultural heritage and environment. In order to offer a solid technical infrastructure, a new concept and expert-tool based on an integrated web-based database/GIS structure is being developed under HazNETH. Given the HazNETH database design contemplates the detection and mapping of diagnostic features from remote sensors (e.g., ground, air and space borne) this paper analyses the use of remote sensing data in landslides studies during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, including a discussion of its potential and research challenges as result of new operational and forthcoming technologies such as the very high spatial resolution optical and infrared imagery of Ikonos, Quickbird, IRS CartoSat-1, ALOS, the satellite based interferometric SAR (InSAR and DInSAR of Radarsat, ERS, Envisat, TerraSAR-X, Cosmo/ SkyMed, ALOS), micro-satellites like the Ple`iades, DMC, RapidEye, airborne LASER altimetry or ground-based differential interferometric SAR. The use of remote sensing data, whether air-, satellite- or ground-based varies according to three main stages of a landslide related study, namely a) detection and identification; b) monitoring; c) spatial analysis and hazard prediction. Accordingly, this paper presents and discusses previous applications of remote sensing tools as related to these three main phases, proposing a conceptual framework for the contribution of remote sensing to the design of databases for natural hazards like debris flows, and identifying areas for further research.},

  abstract = {In the epicentral areas of major recent earthquakes, landslide density scales with peak ground acceleration. Topographic site effects on seismic waves are known to cause important gradients in ground acceleration in individual mountain ridges. Using landslide maps from the epicentral areas of earthquakes near Northridge, California, Chi-Chi, Taiwan, and the Finisterre Mountains of Papua New Guinea, we have investigated the control of these site effects over the location of earthquake induced slope failure. In our examples, earthquake-triggered landslides clustered near ridge crests, where the susceptibility to landsliding was greatest. This pattern is strongest in the Northridge epicentral area, and secondary landslide clusters were found in colluvial slope toes in western Taiwan and above inner gorges in the Finisterre Mountains. In contrast, rainfall-triggered landslides in the western Southern Alps of New Zealand were evenly distributed over all slope segments, and the landslide susceptibility was lowest near ridge crests. Observed patterns of earthquake induced landsliding are consistent in a diverse geological substrate. They correlate with the distribution of very steep slopes in the epicentral areas, but we demonstrate that topographic site effects can also be a strong control. Using the impedance operator method, we have modeled the propagation of seismic waves in a generic ridge-and-valley topography with and without inner gorge. This topography has little effect on incoming P waves, but a strong effect on S waves, giving rise to a significant amplification of peak ground accelerations at or near ridge crests, and at convex knickpoints within ridge flanks. The preferential orientation of landslides away from earthquake epicenters in the Finisterre Mountains and central west Taiwan is likely caused by asymmetric amplification of oblique incoming seismic waves across mountain ridges, and indicates that topographic site effects have dominated over topographic controls on landslide location in these areas. Although orientation of landslides in the Northridge area does not conform with this interpretation, our results suggest that knowledge of topographic site effects and the attenuation of seismic waves can be an important tool in the prediction of spatial patterns of earthquake induced landsliding.},

This is achieved by evaluating the quality of digital terrain models (DTM) of a river bank and an Alpine alluvial fan generated with a fully automated, free-to-use, structure-from-motion package and a smartphone integrated camera (5 megapixels) with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data used to provide a benchmark. To evaluate this approach a 16.2-megapixel digital camera and an established, commercial, close-range and semi-automated software are also employed, and the product of the four combinations of the two types of cameras and software are compared. Results for the river bank survey demonstrate that centimetre-precision DTMs can be achieved at close range (10 m or less), using a smartphone camera and a fully automated package. Results improve to sub-centimetre precision with either higher-resolution images or by applying specific post-processing techniques to the smartphone DTMs. Application to an entire Alpine alluvial fan system shows the degradation of precision scales linearly with image scale, but that (i) the expected level of precision remains and (ii) difficulties in separating vegetation and sediment cover within the results are similar to those typically found when using other photo-based techniques and laser scanning systems.

  abstract = {Dense forest hides a complex landslide terrain in the Kamienne Mountains, a part of the Sudetes range in Central Europe. Combined geomorphological, geophysical and dendrochronological research was carried out in three representative localities in order to decipher patterns of landslide evolution, to determine the extent of slope deformations, and to assess the contemporary activity of landslide terrain. Field mapping revealed the very complex nature of slope failures, both in space and time. Deep-seated sliding was the principal type of movement, and was followed by rock wall retreat by fall in the depletion zone and earthflows in the toe area. Electric resistivity survey proved useful in constraining geometry of landslide units and suggests an occurrence of underground voids in the Lesista landslide area. Dendrochronological research focused on treering reduction, reaction wood, wound and scar analysis that helped to unravel the pattern of debris supply and movement subsequent to the main events, which includes free fall, talus creep, and sliding over snow cover. Today, landslide complexes are at different stages of evolution. Whereas in some places the activity has been largely completed, in others we have found the evidence for failure surfaces ready to accommodate movement. Hence, although some landslides may be relict, it is unjustified to extend this notion to all signs of hillslope instability in the area.},

  abstract = {In the Kamienne Mountains the largest concentration of apparently relict landslides in the Sudetes range occurs. On the northern slopes of Mt Garbatka mass movements re-shaped two adjacent slope hollows and a wide depositional area is located down the valley. The main landslide body is nearly 1 km long and 200–300 m wide. Its flattened surface morphology and the occurrence of large dispersed allochtonous boulders in the distal part suggests a flow-like movement, initiated by shallow translational slides in the upper slopes. The thickness of colluvium, determined by an ERT survey, may reach 10 m. Geomorphic signatures of mass movement are subdued, suggesting that considerable time has elapsed since the origin of the landslide and that large-scale mass movements are likely pre-Holocene in age. This is consistent with the results of an extensive soil survey within the landslide body and on the surrounding slopes. Similarity of soil properties and well-developed horizonation of profiles both within the landslide and outside it shows that no major disturbance has taken place during the soil formation period. Dendrogeomorphological research, in turn, yielded evidence of numerous growth disturbances recorded in tree rings of Norway spruce growing on the landslide body. These signals are interpreted that the slope surface is not entirely stable under current environmental conditions. Flow or creep of landslide material is not very likely, given the characteristics of cover materials, and it is hypothesized that dendrochronological signals develop in response to ground deformation through piping and throughflow. Landslide hazard in the valley below Mt Garbatka appears low at present but to claim complete stability would be premature.},

  abstract = {The Kamienne Mts. in the Sudetes, Central Europe, bear widespread evidence of landsliding which mainly occurred at the boundary between Carboniferous and Permian clastic sedimentary rocks and overlying Permian volcanic and sub-volcanic rocks. 47 individual landslides have been delimited using a combination of LiDAR-derived DEM analysis and field mapping. They have been characterized through a range of geomorphometric parameters and cluster analysis reveals four major groups in terms of surface expression and consequently, likely origin and history. Spatial analysis confirms distinct association of landslides with the steepest terrain and north to east aspect of slopes, but distance from lithological contact emerges as the critical parameter. N80\% of the total landslide area is located within 200 m of a contact, on either side of it. Joint measurements within head scarps at selected landslides indicate that displacements took place along steeply dipping joints in the volcanic cap, but the existence of low angle detachment surfaces in the underlying sedimentary formations is inferred. The spatial distribution of slope deformations coupled with apparently different (although yet unspecified) ages of individual landslides suggests that remodelling of the mountain range by landslides is an ongoing process. Geomorphic history of the area excludes glacial or fluvial erosion and resultant slope debuttressing as the cause of instability. Rather, landslides are considered as mechanisms by which slopes which have become too high and steep due to long-term differential erosion restore their strength equilibrium.},

  abstract = {Vegetated islands are characteristic landforms of braided mountain rivers. Long-term observations and recent morphological and botanical surveys conducted in the gravel-bed Czarny Dunajec, Polish Carpathians, were used to determine the processes and patterns governing initiation and development of islands and their floristic complexity. Moreover, dendrochronologically estimated years of island inception were compared with the timing and magnitude of flood flows in the period 1970–2011 to infer about controls on the formation and persistence of islands in the river. In the high-energy, braided river, islands originate as a result of deposition of large vegetative particles, mostly large wood, on gravel bars and the associated vegetative regeneration of living wood or the growth of seedlings and saplings in the shelter of wood accumulations. Tree-ring dating of the largest trees growing in particular zones of building and established islands indicated a predominant upstream island growth in the river. It results from repeated accumulation of living wood on the head of islands and its subsequent regeneration and contrasts with the progressive downstream growth of islands in the rivers supplied with large, stable logs of the tree species without the capability to re-sprout. The lack of islands from the years 1982–1996 most likely reflects the removal of relatively young islands by two major floods in the 1990s which were, however, unable to destroy older and larger islands. After 1997 the occurrence of low to moderate floods facilitated the formation and persistence of islands. The plant inventory demonstrated that species richness increased non-linearly with the increasing age, area and shoreline length of islands. Islands supported more plant species than the riparian forest and attained comparable species richness at an early stage of development. Fast developing, dynamic and supporting rich plant communities, islands contribute highly to the overall floristic complexity of the river corridor and their re-establishment should be viewed as an important factor in the restoration of hydromorphologically degraded mountain rivers.},

When planning land use activities, it is important both to consider the risks posed by landslides and to account for the eects of land use on rates of landslide movement. Of particular interest in the Paci®c Northwest are the eects of timber harvest in groundwater recharge areas of landslides. Because of variability between sites, and variability over time in precipitation and other natural environmental factors aecting landslide behaviour, empirical data are usually insucient for making such determinations. We describe here the use of simple numerical models of site hydrology, groundwater ¯ow and slope stability for estimating the eects of timber harvest on the stability of the Hazel Landslide in northwestern Washington State. These eects are examined relative to those of river bank erosion at the landslide toe. The data used are distributed in time and space, as are the model results.

  abstract = {Measures of local relief, regional relief, and slope were calculated from digital elevation models (DEMs) for 50 bedrock units in the Ridge and Valley and Blue Ridge provinces of Tennessee. Each of these measures was normalized and the three were then averaged to produce the erosional resistance index (ERI). Bedrock units with higher ERI values include coarse clastics, intermediate clastics, and metaplutonics. Units with lower values include shales, limestones, limestones plus dolostones, and carbonates plus fine clastics. Dolostones tend to have intermediate values. The calculated ERI values were compared with subjective ratings by a geologist with decades of field experience in east Tennessee. Generally, the agreement between the two ratings was good, the most glaring exception being several shales with improbably high ERI values. These turned out to be thin units cropping out beneath very hard sandstones, allowing them to stand higher and steeper than would otherwise be possible. A systematic method for detecting such erroneously high ERI values is suggested. Inspection of a drainage map superimposed on the geology map shows that in a given area, streams tend to flow on rock units with the lowest ERI values. In addition, statistical analysis shows that bedrock units with the lowest ERI values are, on average, almost three times closer to the nearest stream and six times as likely to have streams flowing on them than are units with highest values. Further, the effect of ERI on stream location is strongest for streams with drainage areas between 1 and 30 km2. Thus, small streams appear to be subject to greater lithologic control than are larger streams.},

  abstract = {Current use of land surface curvatures (LSCs) is in a confused state as a large gap has opened up between applications and theoretical work. LSCs exercise important control on changes of gravity potential energy and the equilibrium of the surface, and they are increasingly used in geosciences but they are not consistently defined. This paper offers a comprehensive theoretical framework for definition, classification and interpretation of LSCs. Systematization of known and newly derived relationships between LSCs is followed by extension of the traditional scheme for interpretation. A new comprehensive system of LSCs starts with the basic trio: profile, plan and twisting curvatures, and includes their slope-dependent sub-forms, combinations and imitations. Analysis of their influence on changes of gravitational potential energy available for mass flows is crucial for their understanding, and leads to a new interpretation of difference curvature. The systematic evaluation of LSCs as expressions of slope disequilibrium offers a further interpretation: zero values of LSCs can be considered as important theoretical attractors of landform development. LSCs are increasingly employed for analyses of landslide, flood, snow avalanche, forest fire, soil erosion, mass balance, ground water, digital soil mapping, individual landform identification and land surface segmentation, modelling of landscape development, classification of LIDAR data and visualization of terrain features. Important improvement of LSC use in all these spheres is possible. They are mostly computed in geographical information systems with limited capabilities: the performance of ArcGIS, SAGA, GRASS, LandSerf, Surfer and MICRODEM is compared here. The important interrelations of DEM resolution, accuracy and generalization are demonstrated in relation to the nested hierarchy of land forms and processes. The best interpretable LSCs, and challenges of future progress, are specified at the close of the paper.},

Review and comparison of various approaches to segmentation of the land surface reveals common features, and permits development of a broad theoretical basis for segmentation and for characterization of segments and their boundaries. Within the context of defining landform units that maximise internal homogeneity and external differences, this paper introduces the concept of elementary forms (segments, units) defined by constant values of fundamental morphometric properties and limited by discontinuities of the properties. The basic system of form-defining properties represents altitude and its derivatives, constant values of which provide elementary forms with various types of homogeneity. Every geometric type of elementary form can be characterized by a defining function, which is a specific case of the general polynomial fitted function. Various types of boundary discontinuity and their connections and transformations into other types of morphological unit boundaries are analysed.},

  abstract = {A new quantitative method of morphostructure delimitation based on targeted morphometric analyses and multivariate statistical methods was applied to the Western Carpathians. Nine specific morphostructural regions and sixteen subregions were defined as an improvement on the preceding qualitative subdivision of the area. The integration of geodynamics into the targeted morphometric analysis represents a prerequisite for better interpretability of the delimited regions. The new subdivision of the Western Carpathians therefore reflects first of all the Pliocene–Quaternary geodynamics that controls the development of the present-day relief. The results also help to understand the timing of the basic dome-like morphostructural formation of the Western Carpathians (which began 4–6 million years ago, with the main stage continuing until the Late Pliocene and accelerated uplift taking place since the Middle Pleistocene), as well as the mechanism of its formation. The importance of the Middle Miocene extension for the development of the basin-and-mountain mosaic unique to the Western Carpathians is documented. The projection of the older structural boundaries into the new morphostructural regions and the increasing prevalence of the young morpholineament systems (N–S and W–E) on the southern and northern periphery of the Western Carpathians could be an indication of the gradual spreading of the Western Carpathians into the surrounding lowlands during the last stage of the morphotectonic development.},

  abstract = {Third-order geomorphometric variables (based on third derivatives of the altitudinal field) have been neglected in geomorphometry, but their application to the delimitation of surface objects will lead to their increasing significance in future. New techniques of computation, presented and evaluated here, facilitate their use. This paper summarizes recent knowledge concerning definition, computation and geomorphologic interpretation of these variables. Formulae defining various third-order variables are unified based on the physical definition of slope gradient. Methods for their computation are compared from the point of view of method error and error generated by digital elevation model (DEM) inaccuracy. For exact mathematical test surfaces, the most natural and simple variant of the method of central differences (CD2) shows a method error 2–3 times smaller than the other methods used recently in geomorphometry. However, success in coping with DEM inaccuracy depends (for a given grid mesh) on the number and weighting of points from which the derivative is computed. This was tested for surfaces with varying degrees of random error. Here least squares-based methods are the most effective for mixed derivatives (especially for finer grids and less accurate DEMs), while a variant of the CD method, that repeats numerical evaluation of first derivatives (CD1), is the most successful for derivatives in cardinal directions. The CD2 method is generally the most successful for coarser grids where the method error is dominant. Utilization of third-order variables is documented from examples of terrain feature (ridge, valley and edge) extraction and from a first statistical test of the hypothesis that real segments of the land surface have a tendency to a constant value of some morphometric variable. For detection of (sharp) ridges and valleys, it is shown that the rate of change of tangential curvature is inadequate: rate of change of normal curvature is also required. A basic confirmation of the constant-value tendency is provided.},

  abstract = {Analysis of climatic and topographic evidence from the Cascade Range of Washington State indicates that glacial erosion limits the height and controls the morphology of this range. Glacial erosion linked to long-term spatial gradients in the ELA created a tilted, planar zone of 373 cirques across the central part of the range; peaks and ridges now rise 600 m above this zone. Hypsometric analysis of the region shows that the proportion of land area above the cirques drops sharply, and mean slopes {$>$}30- indicate that the areas above the cirques may be at or near threshold steepness. The mean plus 1j relief of individual cirque basins (570 m) corresponds to the ¨600-m envelope above which peaks rarely rise. The summit altitudes are set by a combination of higher rates of glacial and paraglacial erosion above the ELA and enhanced hillslope processes due to the creation of steep topography. On the high-precipitation western flank of the Cascades, the dominance of glacial and hillslope erosion at altitudes at and above the ELA may explain the lack of a correspondence between stream-power erosion models and measured exhumation rates from apatite (U-Th/He) thermochronometry.},

  abstract = {An important part of landslide research is the interpretation and delineation of landslides, which has increasingly been based on high-resolution satellite images in recent years. Using pre- and post-event FORMOSAT-2 satellite images as the data sources, this study presents a new method that combines four change detection techniques for mapping shallow landslides triggered by typhoons in Taiwan. The four techniques are normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), spectral angle, principal component analysis, and independent component analysis. We apply the multiple change detection (MCD) technique to map landslides triggered by two typhoons of vastly different magnitudes. Comparisons are then made between MCD results with landslide inventory maps compiled by using a single index (change in NDVI) in one case study and visual analysis in another. Comparison results show that MCD can perform better than change in NDVI in dealing with old landslides and landslides with non-homogeneous spectral responses. MCD is also able to detect small landslides, which are often missed by visual analysis. Additionally, landslide maps prepared by MCD include runout features of sediment deposits from debris flows. A relatively fast processing chain, MCD is expected to become a useful new tool for emergency management after a typhoon event, which occurs on average four to five times a year in Taiwan.},

  abstract = {We present a method for the semi-automatic recognition and mapping of recent rainfall induced shallow landslides. The method exploits VHR panchromatic and HR multispectral satellite images, and was tested in a 9.4 km2 area in Sicily, Italy, where on 1 October 2009 a high intensity rainfall event caused shallow landslides, soil erosion, and inundation. Pre-event and post-event images of the study area taken by the QuickBird satellite, and information on the location and type of landslides obtained in the field and through the interpretation of post-event aerial photographs, were used to construct and validate a set of terrain classification models. The models classify each image element (pixel) based on the probability that the pixel contains (or does not contain) a new rainfall induced landslide. To construct and validate the models, a procedure in five steps was adopted. First, the pre-event and the post-event images were pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, co-registered, and corrected for atmospheric disturbance. Next, variables describing changes between the pre-event and the post-event images attributed to landslide occurrence were selected. Next, three classification models were calibrated in a training area using different multivariate statistical techniques. The calibrated models were then applied in a validation area using the same set of independent variables, and the same statistical techniques. Lastly, combined terrain classification models were prepared for the training and the validation areas. The performances of the models were evaluated using four-fold plots and receiver operating characteristic curves. The method proved capable of detecting and mapping the new rainfall induced landslides in the study area. We expect the method to be capable of detecting analogous shallow landslides caused by similar (rainfall) or different (e.g. earthquake) triggers, provided that the event slope failures leave discernable features captured by the post-event satellite images, and that the terrain information and satellite images are of adequate quality. The proposed method can facilitate the rapid production of accurate landslide event-inventory maps, and we expect that it will improve our ability to map landslides consistently over large areas. Application of the method will advance our ability to evaluate landslide hazards, and will foster our understanding of the evolution of landscapes shaped by mass-wasting processes.},

Plots of drainage area versus slope for these mountain ranges exhibit substantial scatter that complicates comparison of range form to analytical theories and landscape evolution models. Contour plots of the density of such data reveal an attractor at the scale of the transition from hillslope processes to channel processes, and log-bin averaging reveals trends that parallel predictions of steady-state erosion laws but with different rate laws for five distinct process domains: hillslopes, valley heads, and colluvial, bedrock, and alluvial valley segments. Slope histograms computed for 100 km2 areas (defined by a 10 ؋ 10 km grid) throughout the OM exhibit approximately normal or exponential distributions in areas of active rock uplift and depositional topography, respectively. Local slope distributions in the OCR also tend to be normally distributed, but some are left-skewed in areas with gentler slopes. Mean slopes determined both over the above referenced grid and a 10-km diam moving window are relatively invariant in the core of the OM in spite of strong contrasts in bedrock erodibility and gradients in long-term rock uplift rates. In contrast, the mean slopes in the OCR parallel latitudinal gradients in rock uplift rates and bedrock erodibility. Hence, the slope distributions in the OM and OCR reflect distinct relationships between development of threshold bedrock and soil-mantled hillslopes and steady-state topography.},

This parameter can be determined directly either in laboratory tests or estimated indirectly using a cheap and conventional method such as Schmidt hammer rebound test and unit weight. Schmidt hammer rebound, unit weight, porosity and uniaxial compressive strength were determined for 104 specimens of different types of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic rocks. Relationships of Schmidt hammer rebound value, unit weight and porosity of different types of rock and uniaxial strength were analyzed statistically using test results. Present relationships of estimating the indirect uniaxial compressive strength of rock were evaluated on the basis of the test results. Statistic analysis of the results showed that estimating indirect uniaxial compressive strength using the present relationships yields different results compared to measured uniaxial compressive strength. Various relationships of estimating uniaxial compressive strength (σc) as a function of combination of three properties of Schmidt hammer rebound (Hs), unit weight (γ) and porosity (P) were applied to find improved relationships. For the relationship between uniaxial compressive strength (σc) and (Hs-P)γ a correlation (R2 =0.9501) was achieved. When effect of porosity as one of the weakness points of rock on the relationship was applied to analyze the test results, a relationship with a better correlation was obtained to estimate uniaxial compressive strength.},

Moores and Twiss emphasize basic principles and methodologies of tectonics, embracing the time-honored perspective of using present processes to understand the past. Comprehensive in scope and detail, coverage includes the effects of plate motions and reconstructions and the resultant structures associated with active rift, transform, and subduction boundaries as well as triple junctions and collision zones; deformations of both the ocean basins and the continents; and orogenic belts. Moores and Twiss present tectonics as an open-ended field of study in which assumptions can be challenged and interpretations changed.

  abstract = {On 4 November 2010, a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (North Italy) reactivated with sudden ground movement. A 450,000 m2 mountainous area moved some metres downslope, but the undeniable signs were only connected to the triggering of a debris flow from the bulging area’s detrital cover and the presence of a continuous perimeter fracture near the crown area. Based on two detailed LiDAR surveys (2 m × 2 m) performed just a few days before and after the event, a quantitative topographic analysis was performed in a GIS environment, integrating morphometric terrain parameters (slope, aspect, surface roughness, hill shade, and curvature). The DEMs analysis highlighted some morphological changes related to deeper as well as shallow movements. Both global and sectorial displacements were widely verified and discussed, finally inferring that the geometry, persistence, and layout of all movements properly justify each current morphostructure, which has the shape of a typical Sackung-type structure with impulsive kinematics. Moreover, a targeted field survey allowed specific clues to be found that confirmed the global deduced dynamics of the slope deformation. Finally, thanks to a ground-based interferometric radar system (GB-InSAR) that was installed a few days after the reactivation, the residual deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) movements were also monitored. In the landslide lower bulging area, a localized material progression of small entities was observed for some months after the parossistic event, indicating a slow dissipation of forces in sectors more distant from the crown area.},

  abstract = {The nature and style of mid-crustal assembly and exhumation during continental collision has been investigated in the Tatra Mountains of the Western Carpathians. The pre-Alpine basement of the Western Carpathians represents the easternmost exposure of the Variscan orogen in Europe, which marks the collision of Laurasia with Gondwanian-affiliated terranes during the Palaeozoic. The Tatric crystalline unit of the Western Tatra in northern Slovakia displays an inverted metamorphic sequence where a high-grade unit comprising migmatites with relicts of eclogite has been thrust over a lower-grade mica schist unit. New geochronological and thermochronological data together with published thermobarometry illuminate the metamorphic history of the Western Tatra. The Upper Unit eclogites with occasionally preserved omphacite record near isothermal decompression from 1.6 GPa to 1.0–1.2 GPa at 750–800 °C which lead to intensive reequilibration at high-pressure granulite facies conditions, comparable to the peak metamorphic conditions of the host migmatite. Both eclogite and migmatite shared a retrograde P–T path following the insertion of the eclogite assemblage into the migmatites. The metamorphic evolution of the Lower Unit mica schist is constrained to peak P–T conditions of 0.6–0.8 GPa and 640 and 660 °C followed by retrogression. This suggests that different rock types of the Western Tatra metamorphic core shared only their exhumation path from mid-crustal levels. ID-TIMS Sm–Nd dating of garnet from eclogite yields a whole rock-garnet isochron age of 337 ± 10 Ma, with an initial εNd isotopic composition of + 8.3. In situ U–Pb dating of monazite from a migmatite surrounding the eclogite shows one age population of c. 380 Ma whereas monazite from a migmatite away from the eclogite preserves a robust 340 ± 11 Ma age which is indistinguishable from Sm–Nd garnet age and U–Pb age of zircons in the anatectic leucosome of the migmatite (347 ± 7 Ma). A younger monazite age population from the migmatite of 300 ± 16 Ma is consistent with 40Ar/39Ar mica ages of c. 310 Ma. This argues for a contemporaneous, and likely shared, exhumation path of the assemblage pair. In situ monazite total-Pb analyses from the Lower Unit mica schists yields xenocrystic and c. 370 Ma ages, but no geochronologic evidence for peak Variscan tectonism. Exhumation of the deep crustal root occurred most probably in a two-stage process. The timing of the high-pressure, eclogite facies metamorphism before the onset of exhumation into the mid crust, was likely between c. 380 Ma and 360 Ma. Subsequent exhumation into the middle crust was coeval with migmatite generation at c. 340 Ma and garnet diffusion modeling suggest \textasciitilde{} 30 °C/Ma cooling rates. The exhumation was likely tectonically forced by the action of a rigid indentor, which prompted the weak lower crust to be heterogeneously extruded to mid-crustal levels at a time coeval with anatexis and subsequently extruded with mid-crustal material to the upper crust.},

  abstract = {Aeolian mineral dust is an important component of the Earth’s environmental systems, playing roles in the planetary radiation balance, as a source of fertilizer for biota in both terrestrial and marine realms and as an archive for understanding atmospheric circulation and paleoclimate in the geologic past. Crucial to understanding all of these roles of dust is the identification of dust sources. Here we review the methods used to identify dust sources active at present and in the past. Contemporary dust sources, produced by both glaciogenic and non-glaciogenic processes, can be readily identified by the use of Earth-orbiting satellites. These data show that present dust sources are concentrated in a global dust belt that encompasses large topographic basins in low-latitude arid and semiarid regions. Geomorphic studies indicate that specific point sources for dust in this zone include dry or ephemeral lakes, intermittent stream courses, dune fields, and some bedrock surfaces. Back-trajectory analyses are also used to identify dust sources, through modeling of wind fields and the movement of air parcels over periods of several days. Identification of dust sources from the past requires novel approaches that are part of the geologic toolbox of provenance studies. Identification of most dust sources of the past requires the use of physical, mineralogical, geochemical, and isotopic analyses of dust deposits. Physical properties include systematic spatial changes in dust deposit thickness and particle size away from a source. Mineralogy and geochemistry can pinpoint dust sources by clay mineral ratios and Sc-Th-La abundances, respectively. The most commonly used isotopic methods utilize isotopes of Nd, Sr, and Pb and have been applied extensively in dust archives of deep-sea cores, ice cores, and loess. All these methods have shown that dust sources have changed over time, with far more abundant dust supplies existing during glacial periods. Greater dust supplies in glacial periods are likely due to greater production of glaciogenic dust particles from expanded ice sheets and mountain glaciers, but could also include dust inputs from exposed continental and insular shelves now submerged. Future dust sources are difficult to assess, but will likely differ from those of the present because of global warming. Global warming could bring about shifts in dust sources by changes in degree or type of vegetation cover, changes in wind strength, and increases or decreases in the size of water bodies. A major uncertainty in assessing dust sources of the future is related to changes in human land use, which could affect land surface cover, particularly due to increased agricultural endeavors and water usage.},

The OSL technique is based on sample stimulation by light to determine the luminescence signal that is stored in the crystal lattices of sediment grains after deposition, burial by later sediment and subsequent exposure to ionizing radiation from radioactive elements in the surrounding sediment. In such sediment dating, two parameters are required: the equivalent dose (i.e. the luminescence signal stored in the grains), and the dose rate (i.e. the ionizing energy from α, β and γ radiation emitted by naturally occurring radioisotopes in the deposit, plus the effects of cosmic radiation). In this research, the OSL technique is not used for dating. The study goal is to analyse only the luminescence signals (the total photon counts) in polymineral samples obtained after light stimulation in the blue (BLSL) and infrared (IRSL) wavelengths using a portable OSL reader designed and built at the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC). Three fluvial case studies – from Cambodia, Australia and Mexico – are used to illustrate the geomorphological interpretations possible with the portable OSL reader data from sediments resulting from a range of different depositional processes. The case studies show that aspects of sediment's transport and depositional processes can be inferred from the portable OSL reader data, providing valuable insights into geomorphological history.},

Here we investigate two large rock avalanches in the Obersee valley of the Glarner Alps, Switzerland, providing detailed mapping of landslide and related Quaternary phenomena, revised volume estimates for each event, and surface exposure dating of rock avalanche deposits. The Rautispitz rock avalanche originated from the southern flank of the Obersee valley, releasing approximately 91 million m3 of limestone on steeply-dipping bedding planes. Debris had maximum horizontal travel distance of \textasciitilde 5000m, a fahrboeschung angle (relating fall height to length) of 18°, and was responsible for the creation of Lake Obersee; deposits are more than 130m thick in places. The Platten rock avalanche encompassed a source volume of 11 million m3 sliding from the northern flank of the Obersee valley on similar steeply-dipping limestone beds (bedrock forms a syncline under the valley). Debris had a maximum horizontal travel distance of 1600m with a fahrboeschung angle of 21°, and is more than 80m thick in places. Deposits of the Platten rock avalanche are superposed atop those from the Rautispitz event at the end of the Obersee valley where they dam Lake Haslensee. Runout for both events was simulated using the dynamic analysis code DAN3D; results showed excellent match to mapped deposit extents and thickness and helped confirm the hypothesized single-event failure scenarios. 36Cl cosmogenic nuclide surface exposure dating of 13 deposited boulders revealed a Younger Dryas age of 12.6±1.0ka for the Rautispitz rock avalanche and a mid-Holocene age of 6.1±0.8ka for the Platten rock avalanche. A seismological trigger is proposed for the former event due to potentially correlated turbidite deposits in nearby Lake Zurich.},

These observations may be explained by a simple quantitative model of slope degradation in which the rate of change of elevation at a point on a slope profile is proportional to the curvature of the profile at that point. The convex-upward (negative curvature) slope crest will be lowered and the concave-upward (positive curvature) slope base will be raised. The model assumes that the slope remains covered with loose debris and that the local rate of downslope movement of the debris is proportional to the local hillslope gradient. The model provides a simple morphologic dating technique for fault scarps in cohesionless material. It predicts that the rate at which the maximum slope angle of a scarp decreases is related to the initial height of the scarp. It may also be possible to apply the morphologic dating technique to hillslopes formed in other ways.},

  abstract = {An ever-increasing trend of extreme rainfall events in South Korea due to climate change is causing shallow landslides and shallow landslide induced debris flows in the mountains that cover 70\% of the total land area of the nation. These catastrophic, gravity-driven processes cost the government several billion won in losses, and attendant fatalities, every year. The most common type of landslide observed is the shallow landslide occurring at 1–3 m depth, which may mobilize into a catastrophic debris flow. A landslide early warning system encompassing different scale-based stages is used to predict potential areas for both the landslide types. Current study focusing on the first stage landslide hazard assessment at regional or medium scale requires the development of spatially evolving landslide hazard maps for both types of landslides based on the real-time rainfall. However, lack of complete landslide inventory data motivates the development of temporal and spatial models as independent components of the landslide hazard. Most of the existing temporal assessment schemes traditionally rooted in recurrence-based concepts does not consider soil factors and are not suitable to be incorporated in to the landslide early warning system since real-time rainfall cannot be considered. This motivated the development of a new probabilistic temporal model termed the extreme rainfall-induced landslide index. The probabilistic index was developed in Gangwon Province through a logistic regression using four factors; namely, continuous rainfall, 20-days antecedent rainfall, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and storage capacity. The developed model exhibited high area under the curve (AUC) values of 82\% and 91\% obtained for the training and validation curves, exhibiting good performance of the statistical index. Also, a high performance susceptibility model (training and validation AUC values of 96\% and 94\%, respectively) was developed using a logistic regression analysis, for Deokjeok-ri Creek, located in Gangwon province. Assuming the independence of the hazard components, a dynamic hazard index (DHI) was established through a joint probability of both the well validated models. The DHI was used to study the evolution of landslide hazard for the July 2006 extreme rainfall-induced landslide events in Deokjeok-ri Creek.},

Landslide susceptibility, expressed as the possibility of a landslide occurring in a certain area, is determined on the basis of the relationship between specific geofactors and landslides that already occurred. Thus, identification and mapping of landslides are essential for modelling in the study area. A newly generated landslide inventory comprises historical as well as presentday databases and maps, and includes 600 mass movements. This data set is focused on spatial distribution of naturally triggered landslide processes, which represent the predominant type of mass movements in the study area. The data are analysed with regard to geological environment, geomorphological characteristics, and chronological distribution.},

The original rock mass slid initially along a listric slip surface - which required the rupture of the mass itself by internal shearing and caused the formation of a horst-and-graben morphology - and attained a high speed. Then part of the mass fell from a morphological step, and moved about 800m forward. In this landslide, the morphological and morphometrical examination - which is also based on a reconstruction of the pre-landslide topography - indicates that mobility was rather low when related to volume and to the control exerted by local morphology. The event might have been induced by an earthquake in the 4th century.},

  abstract = {The Schmidt hammer is a useful tool applied by geomorphologists to measure rock strength in field conditions. The essence of field application is to obtain a sufficiently large dataset of individual rebound values, which yields a meaningful numerical value of mean strength. Although there is general agreement that a certain minimum sample size is required to proceed with the statistics, the choice of size (i.e. number of individual impacts) was usually intuitive and arbitrary. In this paper we show a simple statistical method, based on the two-sample Student’s t-test, to objectively estimate the minimum number of rebound measurements. We present the results as (1) the ‘mean’ and ‘median’ solutions, each providing a single estimate value, and (2) the empirical probability distribution of such estimates based on many field samples. Schmidt hammer data for 14 lithologies, 13–81 samples for each, with each sample consisting of 40 individual readings, have been evaluated, assuming different significance levels. The principal recommendations are: (1) the recommended minimum sample size for weak and moderately strong rock is 25; (2) a sample size of 15 is sufficient for sandstones and shales; (3) strong and coarse rocks require 30 readings at a site; (4) the minimum sample size may be reduced by one-third if the context of research allows for higher significance level for test statistics. Interpretations based on less than 10 readings from a site should definitely be avoided. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The UAV capability for imaging fissures and displacements on the landslide surface has been evaluated, and the subsequent image processing approaches for suitably georectifying the data have been assessed. For Super-Sauze, horizontal displacements of 7 to 55 m between a high-resolution airborne ortho-photo of May 2007 and a UAV-based ortho-mosaic of October 2008 have been measured. Fixed areas of persistent deformation have been identified, producing fissures of different distributions and orientations comparable to glacial crevasses, and relating directly to the bedrock topography. The UAV has demonstrated its capability for producing valuable landslide data but improvements are required to reduce data processing time for the efficient generation of ortho-mosaics based on photogrammetric DTMs, in order to minimise georeferencing errors.},

The N18O record dated with Th/U is interpreted as an indicator of paleohumidity. Spectral analysis of N18O from 6000 a BP up to the recent top of a stalagmite from the Atta cave yields statistically significant peaks at 1450, 117, 64 and 57 a. Additionally we find a good correlation of the stalagmite’s N18O and v14C from European tree rings. The 1450 a cycle in the stalagmite probably is analogous to the pervasive millennial scale climate cycle described by Bond et al. [Science 278 (1997) 1257\^1266; 294 (2001) 2130\^2136] derived from the amount of ice rafted debris in deep sediments from the North Atlantic. Our results suggest that the centennial to millennial shifts observed in the North Atlantic are accompanied by synchronous shifts of the climate in Northern and Central Europe, which most probably can be attributed to solar irradiation variations.},

  abstract = {The increased detection sensitivity offered by AMS has dramatically expanded the utility of 10Be. As these applications become more sophisticated attention has focused on the accuracy of the 10Be standards used to calibrate the AMS measurements. In recent years it has become apparent that there is a discrepancy between two of the most widely used 10Be AMS standards, the ICN 10Be standard and the NIST 10Be standard. The ICN (ICN Chemical \& Radioisotope Division) 10Be AMS standard was calibrated by radioactive decay counting. Dilutions, ranging from 5 · 10À13 to 3 · 10À11 10Be/Be, have been prepared and are extensively used in many AMS laboratories. The NIST 10Be standard, prepared at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), is calibrated by mass spectrometric isotope ratio measurements. To provide an independent calibration of the 10Be standards we implanted a known number of 10Be atoms in both Si detectors and Be foil targets. The 10Be concentrations in these targets were measured by AMS. The results were compared with both the ICN and NIST AMS standards. Our 10Be measurements indicate that the 10Be/9Be isotopic ratio of the ICN AMS standard, which is based on a 10Be half-life of 1.5 · 106 yr, is 1.106 ± 0.012 times lower than the nominal value. Since the decay rate of the ICN standard is well determined, the decrease in 10Be/9Be ratio requires that the 10Be half-life be reduced to (1.36 ± 0.07) · 106 yr. The quoted uncertainty includes a ±5\% uncertainty in the activity measurement carried out by ICN. In a similar fashion, we determined that the value of the NIST 10Be standard (SRM4325) is (2.79 ± 0.03) · 10À11 10Be/9Be, within error of the certified value of (2.68 ± 0.14) · 10À11. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) internal standards were also included in this study. We conclude that the 9Be(n, c) neutron cross section is 7.8 ± 0.23 mb, without taking into account the uncertainty in the neutron irradiation.},

  abstract = {Thaw slumping existing on two slopes in permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is studied with their geological features, deformations and ground temperature in this paper. The failure shows as collapse and slide of active layer along the massive ground-ice surface. The field-monitored data show that the retrogressively extending area, soil-body sliding velocity and the water content of the soils in the failed area strikingly change with the air temperature and slope facing aspect. On the south-facing slope, the values of all of these items are higher than that on the north-facing slope. The mean annual ground temperature in the failed area on the south-facing slope is evidently higher than that in the undisturbed natural ground and that in the north-facing slope. In addition, the input of heat into the permafrost below the sliding mass on the south-facing slope is more than the output. Therefore the permafrost in the slope processes degradation when landslide occurs. The genesis of this kind of slope failure is closely related to ice-rich frozen soils and activities of engineering cut. Based on static balance analysis, the stability estimating method for such landslide is presented considering the seepage of ice-melting ground water in the paper. At last, the engineering measures of preventing thaw slumping are proposed too.},

  abstract = {The mechanical properties of jointed rock masses, such as strength, deformation and the failure mechanism, can be understood only by studying the sensitivity of jointed rock mass strength (both the peak and residual strengths) to the factors that affect it. An orthogonal design of uniaxial compression tests was simulated on eighteen groups of jointed rock specimens having different geometric and mechanical properties using RFPA2D (Rock Failure Process Analysis) code. The results show that the peak strength is controlled by the geometric parameters of the joints, but that the residual strength is controlled by the mechanical properties of the joint interfaces. The failure mode of jointed rock specimens is mainly shear failure. Joint quantity, or density, is the most important index that affects jointed rock mass strength and engineering quality.},

Several rock-fall events, which have occurred in the European Alps during the 20th century, are possibly related to warm permafrost. This study undertakes a systematic parameterization of rock-fall events in order to increase information about thermal and topographic conditions under which rock instabilities develop in areas of mountain permafrost. Thermal conditions of historically documented starting zones are parameterized by applying either empirical rules or GIS-based spatial models; slope is derived from DTMs. Despite the relatively small number of events documented so far (around 20), the first results presented clearly indicate that the factor ‘permafrost’ must be considered in con- nection with rock-falls from high mountain slopes.},

  abstract = {A Ground-Based SAR (GB-SAR) interferometer was employed to measure the surface displacements of a landslide occurring in the Carnian Alps, north-eastern Italy, which has affected a national road and seriously damaged a road tunnel still under construction. Moreover, since the landslide is located on the left bank of the Tagliamento River Valley, it is feared that this mass movement might dam the river, creating a basin that would increase natural hazard for the valley inhabitants. The data collected from December 2002 to July 2005 by a conventional monitoring system, consisting of a GPS network and boreholes equipped with inclinometric tubes, showed that the landslide was moving at a quasi-constant rate of about 3 cm per year. Due to the slow deformation rate of the landslide, a recently developed GB-SAR technique based on the analysis of a restricted ensemble of coherent points was used. Two surveys, each lasting two days, were planned in December 2004 and July 2005, in order to map and measure the surface displacements that occurred over time. The results from the radar were compared with the ones derived from the GPS monitoring network. An agreement was achieved among the data collected, showing the capability of the GB-SAR technique to measure displacements even within a time span of several months between the surveys.},

  abstract = {The Nordnes rockslide in northern Norway poses a threat to local settlements along the nearby fjord due to its potential of generating tsunamis. Therefore, a monitoring program was initiated in 2007. Evaluation of the resulting monitoring data is expected to provide important contributions to the understanding of the sliding mechanisms. This paper focuses on statistical analyses of continuous laser and crackmeter measurements at the Nordnes rockslide during a period of 16months. Annual linear displacements and seasonal fluctuations were estimated from time series of 3 lasers and 10 crackmeters. Results from the analyses show that the north-westernmost part of the area has the largest movement of more than 5cm per year, which makes this part the most critical in terms of generation of a rapid rockslide. The amplitudes of the seasonal fluctuations estimated from crackmeter time series were approximately 0.5mm. The largest displacements clearly occur in autumn and early winter with a stagnation or retreat phase in spring and summer. Thus, the movements are not increased during snowmelt which is a normal seasonal characteristic elsewhere. Although the temperature changes have a significant effect on the observed displacements, the seasonal variations could not fully be modelled with temperature terms in the regression models suggesting that there are other additional controlling factors. The rockslide is localized in arctic and periglacial conditions, and the documented seasonal variations are interpreted to be linked to effects of deformations caused by seasonal frost and permafrost. Prediction intervals for future displacements were also derived from the current time series. These prediction intervals are considered useful for the evaluation of future measurements and may serve as basis for defining alert thresholds for possible future early warning systems.},

  abstract = {Transient landscape disequilibrium is a common response to climatic fluctuations between glacial and interglacial conditions. Such landscapes are best suited to the investigation of catchment-wide response to changes in incision. The geomorphology of the Trub and Grosse Fontanne, adjacent stream systems in the Napf region of the Swiss Molasse, was analyzed using a 2-m LIDAR DEM. The two catchments were impacted by the Last Glacial Maximum, LGM, even though the glaciers never overrode this region. They did, however, cause base levels to drop by as much as 80 m. Despite their similar tectonic, lithologic and climatic settings, these two basins show very different responses to the changing boundary conditions. Stream profiles in the Trub tend to be smooth, while in the Fontanne, numerous knickzones are visible. Similarly, cut-and-fill terraces are abundant in the Trub watershed, but absent in the Fontanne, where deep valleys have been incised. The Trub appears to be a coupled hillslope–channel system because the morphometrics throughout the basin are uniform. The morphology of hillslopes upstream of the knickzones in the Fontanne is identical to that of the Trub basin, but different downstream of the knickzones, suggesting that the lower reaches of the Fontanne have been decoupled from the hillslopes. However, the rapid incision of the Fontanne is having little effect on the adjacent upper hillslopes.},

  abstract = {Entropy is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics that is important in many fields, including image processing, neurobiology, urban planning, and sustainability. As of recently, the application of Boltzmann entropy for landscape patterns was mostly limited to the conceptual discussion. However, in the last several years, a number of methods for calculating Boltzmann entropy for landscape mosaics and gradients were proposed. We developed an R package belg as an open source tool for calculating Boltzmann entropy of landscape gradients. The package contains functions to calculate relative and absolute Boltzmann entropy using the hierarchy-based and the aggregation-based methods. It also supports input raster with missing (NA) values, allowing for calculations on real data. In this study, we explain ideas behind implemented methods, describe the core functionality of the software, and present three examples of its use. The examples show the basic functions in this package, how to adjust Boltzmann entropy values for data with missing values, and how to use the belg package in larger workflows. We expect that the belg package will be a useful tool in the discussion of using entropy for a description of landscape patterns and facilitate a thermodynamic understanding of landscape dynamics.},

  abstract = {A landslide is one of natural hazards that affect humans and their livelihood especially in the mountainous area. The increasing landslide risk due to global climate change and demographic pressure demands integration between disaster risk reduction and sustainability management, for instance, the recently increasing people's awareness of the landslide and its impacts. Landslides occur in particular location regarding both physical and non-physical features of an area, comprising geomorphology, geology, geomorphometry, human activities, earthquake probability, rainfall occurrence, and etc. This research aims to understand the characteristics of the specific land surface that bears susceptibility to landslides using a geomorphometric approach and to analyze the relationship between geomorphometric characteristics and landslide events. The Tinalah watershed is located in Menoreh Mountains, one of mountainous areas in Java where highly frequent landslides occur. Geomorphometric characteristics, derived from DEMs with 2x2-m2 grid resolution, consist of elevation, slope gradient, aspect, profile curvature, plan curvature, and general curvature. The inventory of landslide events, consisting of the location, time, area, perimeter, typology, and activity, is derived from the field maps, local government's report analysis, and interviews with local people. In this research, landslide distribution is mapped using the multi-temporal records of landslide events during 2006-2010. A raster-based spatial analysis reveals the relationship between landslide events and geomorphometric characteristics. Each variable shows the quantitative information of landslide distribution in the Tinalah watershed. As a result, geomorphometric characteristics have the most significant relationship with the landslide distribution in this study area.},

Here we present a chronology of its retreat based on in situ produced cosmogenic 10Be from erratic boulders at Cape Lachman, northern James Ross Island. Schmidt hammer testing was adopted to assess the weathering state of erratic boulders in order to better interpret excess cosmogenic 10Be from cumulative periods of pre-exposure or earlier release from the glacier. The weighted mean exposure age of five boulders based on Schmidt hammer data is 12.9±1.2ka representing the beginning of the deglaciation of lower-lying areas ({$<$}60ma.s.l.) of the northern James Ross Island, when Northern Prince Gustav Ice Stream split from the remaining James Ross Island ice cover. This age represents the minimum age of the transition from grounded ice stream to floating ice shelf in the middle continental shelf areas of the northern Prince Gustav Channel. The remaining ice cover located at higher elevations of northern James Ross Island retreated during the early Holocene due to gradual decay of terrestrial ice and increase of equilibrium line altitude. Schmidt hammer R-values are inversely correlated with 10Be exposure ages and could be used as a proxy for exposure history of individual granite boulders in this region and favour the hypothesis of earlier release of boulders with excessive 10Be concentrations from glacier directly at this site. These data provide evidences for an earlier deglaciation of northern James Ross Island when compared with other recently presented cosmogenic nuclide based deglaciation chronologies, but this timing coincides with rapid increase of atmospheric temperature in this marginal part of Antarctica.},

  abstract = {Ice-rafting evidence for a “1500-year cycle” sparked considerable debate on millennial-scale climate change and the role of solar variability. Here, we reinterpret the last 70,000 years of the subpolar North Atlantic record, focusing on classic DSDP Site 609, in the context of newly available raw data, the latest radiocarbon calibration (Marine09) and ice core chronology (GICC05), and a wider range of statistical methodologies. A w1500-year oscillation is primarily limited to the short glacial Stage 4, the age of which is derived solely from an ice flow model (ss09sea), subject to uncertainty, and offset most from the original chronology. Results from the most well-dated, younger interval suggest that the original 1500 Æ 500 year cycle may actually be an admixture of the w1000 and w2000 cycles that are observed within the Holocene at multiple locations. In Holocene sections these variations are coherent with 14C and 10Be estimates of solar variability. Our new results suggest that the “1500-year cycle” may be a transient phenomenon whose origin could be due, for example, to ice sheet boundary conditions for the interval in which it is observed. We therefore question whether it is necessary to invoke such exotic explanations as heterodyne frequencies or combination tones to explain a phenomenon of such fleeting occurrence that is potentially an artifact of arithmetic averaging.},

  abstract = {Permafrost is a key element of the cryosphere and an essential climate variable in the Global Climate Observing System. There is no remote-sensing method available to reliably monitor the permafrost thermal state. To estimate permafrost distribution at a hemispheric scale, we employ an equilibrium state model for the temperature at the top of the permafrost (TTOP model) for the 2000–2016 period, driven by remotely-sensed land surface temperatures, down-scaled ERA-Interim climate reanalysis data, tundra wetness classes and landcover map from the ESA Landcover Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project. Subgrid variability of ground temperatures due to snow and landcover variability is represented in the model using subpixel statistics. The results are validated against borehole measurements and reviewed regionally. The accuracy of the modelled mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at the top of the permafrost is ±2\,°C when compared to permafrost borehole data. The modelled permafrost area (MAGT {$<$}0\,°C) covers 13.9\,×\,106\,km2 (ca. 15\% of the exposed land area), which is within the range or slightly below the average of previous estimates. The sum of all pixels having isolated patches, sporadic, discontinuous or continuous permafrost (permafrost probability {$>$}0) is around 21\,×\,106\,km2 (22\% of exposed land area), which is approximately 2\,×\,106\,km2 less than estimated previously. Detailed comparisons at a regional scale show that the model performs well in sparsely vegetated tundra regions and mountains, but is less accurate in densely vegetated boreal spruce and larch forests.},

The understanding of such a process and the resulting ejection of grains is, in particular, crucial to describe aeolian sand transport. We present here recent experimental results on the collision and ejection process when varying the angle and the speed of the incident bead. We performed numerical simulations of one bead collisions on the surface of a static granular medium. The simulations have been done for two and three dimensional packings of beads. The effects of the incident bead velocity, the shot angle, the mechanical parameters and the packing structure are analyzed for ordered and disordered 2D packings but only disordered 3D packings. The 2D results are in good agreement with available experimental data. The 3D simulations give good preliminary results about the shock wave propagation through the stacking and provides new insights in the ejection process (“splash function”).},

  abstract = {The Origins of Mountains approaches mountains from facts about mountain landscapes rather than theory. The book illustrates that almost everywhere, mountains arose by vertical uplift of a former plain, and by a mixture of cracking and warping by earth movements, and erosion by rivers and glaciers, the present mountainous landscapes were created. It also gives evidence that this uplift only occured in the last few million years, a time scale which does not fit the plate tectonics theory. Another fascinating part of the evidence, shows that mountain uplift correlates very well with climatic change. Mountain building could have been responsible for the onset of the ice age. It certainly resulted in the creation of new environments. Fossil plants and animals are used in places to work out the time of mountain uplift, which in turn helps to explain biogeographical distributions.},

  abstract = {The main landforms within the glacially scoured Precambrian rocks of the Swedish west coast are closely connected to the principal structural pattern and have lately been explained as mainly a result of etch processes, probably during the Mesozoic and with a possible second period of etching during the Neogene. To explore the effect of multiple glacial erosion on the rock surfaces, an island with two different lithologies and with striae from different directions was selected for a detailed study, focusing on the shape of roches moutonne´es. Air-photo interpretation of bedrock lineaments and roches moutonne´es combined with detailed field mapping and striae measurements are used to interpret the structural and lithological control on the resulting shape. The study reveals a significant difference in shape between roches moutonne´es in augen-granite and orthogneiss. Low elongated and streamlined roches moutonne´es occur in the gneiss area, striated by a Late Weichselian ice flow from the NE. This ice flow is subparallel with both the local dominant trend of topographically well-expressed joints and the schistosity of the gneiss. Frequently, there are no signs of quarrying on the lee-sides of the gneiss roches moutonne´es and hence they resemble the shape of whalebacks, or ruwares, as typically associated with the exposed basal weathering surface found in tropical areas. The granite roches moutonne´es were formed by an older ice flow from the ESE, which closely followed the etched WNW–ESE joint system of the granite. Late Weichselian ice flow from the NE caused only minor changes of the landforms. On the contrary, marks of the early ESE ice flow are poorly preserved in the gneiss area, where it probably never had any large effect as the flow was perpendicular to both schistosity and structures and, accordingly, also to the pre-glacial relief. The study demonstrates that coincidence between ice flow direction and pre-glacially etched structures is most likely to determine the effects of glacial erosion.

The deepwater sediments were deposited along the flanks and top of growing folds. Beside load and fluid escape structures, which are commonly found in sediment gravity flow systems, soft-sediment deformation is mainly related to fluidization of coarse-grained beds and downslope gliding of meter-thick sediment packages. Common structures affecting single or several beds are: hydroplastic folding of fine-grained beds in a coarse-grained fluidized matrix, symmetric or asymmetric mullions at the base of coarse-grained beds, and folding of heterolithic units into coarse-grained beds. Folds have varying geometries and styles, and fold axes are scattered. Soft-sediment folds also affect thick sediment packages. These folds are uniformly verging asymmetric metric to dekametric folds, formed at different degrees of lithification. Rheology of sandstones in such folds ranges from ductile to semi-brittle and brittle. Fold axes tightly cluster about one direction. The first group of deformational structures is attributed to slump-related deformation, whereas the second group represents folds related to tectonic deformation.},

  abstract = {Slope failures have been traditionally detected by field inspection and aerial-photo interpretation. These approaches are generally insufficient to identify subtle landforms, especially those generated during the early stages of failures, and particularly where the site is located in forested and remote terrains. We present the identification and characterization of several large and medium size slope failures previously undetected within the Orri massif, Central Pyrenees. Around 130 scarps were interpreted as being part of Rock Slope Failures (RSFs), while other smaller and more superficial failures were interpreted as complex movements combining colluvium slow flow/slope creep and RSFs. Except for one of them, these slope failures had not been previously detected, albeit they extend across a 15\% of the studied region. The failures were identified through the analysis of a high-resolution (1 m) LIDAR-derived bare earth Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Most of the scarps are undetectable either by fieldwork, photo interpretation or 5 m resolution topography analysis owing to their small heights (0.5 to 2 m) and their location within forest areas. In many cases, these landforms are not evident in the field due to the presence of other minor irregularities in the slope and the lack of open views due to the forest. 2D and 3D visualization of hillshade maps with different sun azimuths provided an overall picture of the scarp assemblage and permitted a more complete analysis of the geometry of the scarps with respect to the slope and the structural fabric. The sharpness of some of the landforms suggests ongoing activity, which should be explored in future detailed studies in order to assess potential hazards affecting the Portainé ski resort. Our results reveal that close analysis of the 1 m LIDAR-derived DEM can significantly help to detect early-stage slope deformations in high mountain regions, and that expert judgment of the DEM is essential when dealing with subtle landforms. The incorporation of this approach in regional mapping represents a great advance in completing the catalogue of slope failures and will eventually contribute to a better understanding of the spatial factors controlling them.},

Permafrost observatories with boreholes were established along a north–south transect of Alaska in undisturbed permafrost terrain. The analysis and interpretation of annual temperature measurements in the boreholes and daily temperature measurements of the air, ground and permafrost surfaces made with automated temperature loggers are reported. Permafrost temperatures warmed along this transect coincident with a statewide warming of air temperatures that began in 1977. At two sites on the Arctic Coastal Plain, the warming was seasonal, greatest during bwinterQ months (October through May) and least during bsummerQ months (June through September). Permafrost temperatures peaked in the early 1980s and then decreased in response to slightly cooler air temperatures and thinner snow covers. Arctic sites began warming again typically about 1986 and Interior Alaska sites about 1988. Gulkana, the southernmost site, has been warming slowly since it was drilled in 1983. Air temperatures were relatively warm and snow covers were thicker-than-normal from the late 1980s into the late 1990s allowing permafrost temperatures to continue to warm. Temperatures at some sites leveled off or cooled slightly at the turn of the century. Two sites (Yukon River Bridge and Livengood) cooled during the period of observations. The magnitude of the total warming at the surface of the permafrost (through 2003) was 3 to 4 8C for the Arctic Coastal Plain, 1 to 2 8C for the Brooks Range including its northern and southern foothills, and 0.3 to 1 8C south of the Yukon River.},

A 14C age of 7785± 190 cal yr BP of a palaeosoil within an alluvial fan downlapping the rock avalanche is consistent with the event age. The distal 2 km of the rock-avalanche deposit is characterized by a highly regular array of transverse ridges that were previously interpreted as terminal moraines of Late-Glacial. ‘Jigsaw-puzzle structure’ of gravel to boulder-size clasts in the ridges and a matrix of cataclastic gouge indicate a rock avalanche origin. For a wide altitude range the avalanche deposit is preserved, and the event age of mass-wasting precludes both runout over glacial ice and subsequent glacial overprint. The regularly arrayed transverse ridges thus were formed during freezing of the rock avalanche deposits.},

Results of the different methods were analysed separately, before conclusions about sediment thickness and geomorphologic implications were drawn. The results from the three methods were compared to focus on the quality of the methods and their field utility, with respect to portability of equipment, required man-power and measurement time. In this study, ground penetrating radar and seismic refraction proved to be the most suitable with respect to the quality and resolution of the subsurface information and the level of field utility. Sediment thicknesses of 15 m on a rectilinear slope and more than 30 m on a talus cone have been measured; a backweathering rate of approximately 700 mm ka−1 was established. Furthermore, the radar delivered detailed internal sediment structure as well as interfaces between talus and rock glacier. The combined geophysical investigation produced a detailed image of the subsurface composition of the two landform complexes that enhance the understanding of the paraglacial landform evolution in this hanging valley.},

A composite fabric developed along a lateral thrust ramp in the Apennines reveals mesoscopic normal faults that truncate the thrust surface, overprint the S-fabric and merge downwards in a foreland-directed splay, leaving the thrust footwall undeformed. These relationships indicate syn-/late-thrusting extension, which we interpret as induced by hanging-wall gravitational collapse.

  abstract = {In this work, a simple methodology is presented for processing high-resolution topographical data over wide areas. It is based on digital elevation model of differences (DEMoD) among high-resolution digital models (HRDEM) produced from lightdetection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Because these qualitative approaches based on HRDEMs can be affected by errors related to misalignment between different passes of the airborne sensor and errors in classifying points, a simplified strategy was undertaken for their semi-automatic correction and supervision for analyzing geomorphological changes. Besides, it became possible to detect, delineate, and classify a total of 47 natural landslides and 50 slope-cut failures over an area of 234km2 on the basis of the analysis of the LiDAR products (DEMs and DEMoD) and the orthophotography imagery inspection integrated in a geographical information system (GIS). Most of the displacements detected were probably generated during the winter of 2009–2010 when a new record of cumulative rainfall was reached. The displacement rate of these movements cannot be known with precision, but the minimum velocity that can be obtained is 0.3m/year regarding the period between the two data acquisitions carried out in November 2008 and July 2010. On the other hand, a comparison was made of the existing susceptibility maps with respect to this new inventory, which indicated greater landslide frequency in areas of moderate susceptibility levels. The influence of treating inventories at different temporal scales is discussed.},

  abstract = {Fault-bounded mountain ranges with along-strike variations in mean slope angle and local relief offer the opportunity to investigate how denudation depends on these topographic parameters. We determined catchment-wide denudation rates along two actively growing, fault-bounded mountain ranges (the Yumu and western Longshou Shan) from 10Be concentrations in quartz from stream sediments. Both ranges expose (1) low-grade metamorphic Paleozoic rocks in their center, and (2) unmetamorphosed Cretaceous red beds near the tips of the range-bounding thrust faults. Field observations document debris flows, shallow landsliding, and surface wash as dominant mechanisms of mass transport on the hillslopes. Denudation rates obtained for the Paleozoic metasediments range from ∼ 100 to ∼ 300 mm ka− 1 and correlate linearly with mean slope angle and local relief. In contrast, Cretaceous sediments exhibit mainly higher and more variable denudation rates between ∼ 30 and ∼ 500 mm ka− 1, although slope and relief values are lower for these catchments. The higher denudation rates in the Cretaceous red beds are interpreted as resulting from their lower mechanical strength as compared to the resistant Paleozoic rocks. This important lithologic control on denudation demonstrates that uniform catchment lithologies and rock strength are essential for deciphering the effect of topographic indices on the rate of denudation.},

  abstract = {Deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) with characteristic sackung landforms (e.g., double crests, trenches, uphill-facing scarps, and toe bulging) are considered by some researchers to be diagnostic features indicating past mountain glaciations. However, an extensive literature review on sackung features throughout the world reveals that in some regions, paraglacial processes are not the causes of such phenomena. Sackungen occur across a diverse spectrum of mountain types, with different morphoclimatic histories, including regions that have never experienced glaciation. To reinforce that sackungen may originate independently of glaciation, we also include two case studies from the Western Carpathians (Czech Republic and Slovakia) which are supported by detailed geomorphic mapping, trenching and absolute dating (10Be, 14C and OSL). On the Ondřejník ridge (Outer Western Carpathians, Czech Republic), sackungen occur in the mid-Holocene in the medium-high mountains which are beyond the Pleistocene glacial limits. On the Salatín Mt. (Tatra Mts., Slovakia), the sackungen, which occur in formerly glaciated terrain, date between \textasciitilde{} 7.5 and 4.2 ka BP, representing a N 4 ka time lag after the disappearance of glaciers. This suggests that the direct link between the ice retreat and the onset of sackung formation is not obvious, even in the case of the once glaciated mountain range. Although paraglacial stress release is undoubtedly one of the crucial causes of sackung genesis, in many mountain regions, it is not the only important mechanism. Therefore, despite occurring in numerous (de)glaciated mountains, sackung features cannot be considered as proof of past mountain glaciations, e.g., during analysis of extraterrestrial settings.},

  abstract = {One of the largest long-runout landslides in the modern history of the Czech Republic originated on the southern slopes of the Girová Mountain (Outer Western Carpathians) at the end of extreme rainfalls in May 2010. The structurally predisposed Girová Mountain rockslide occurred very quickly within fault-weakened, deeply-weathered flysch bedrock. Its main phase, during which a wedge-like block collapsed in the upper part of slope, lasted for a few hours. The overloaded slope collapsed and its motion lasted for the following 3 days. The May 2010 Girová Mountain rockslide is an excellent case of a recurrent long-runout landslide nested within a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation with a long history of Late Quaternary mass movements. The chronology of slope failures within the studied slope was reconstructed by means of radiocarbon dating and dendrogeomorphological analysis. At least one Holocene long-runout landslide (7.4 cal ka BP) and several smaller failures (\textasciitilde{} 1.5 and \textasciitilde{} 0.6 cal ka BP) preceded this recent catastrophic failure. Dendrogeomorphological analysis showed that the failure had been preceded by at least 80-year-long creep movement that accelerated over the years due to extreme rainfall events. Despite the fact that extreme precipitation of May 2010 represented the last incremental change before catastrophic collapse of the slope, its main reason was gradual weakening of rock massif and concentrated creeping (with some accelerated phases) in the upper part of the slope deformation.},

  abstract = {Although the dynamics of individual rock-slope failures above recently shrinking glaciers have received increasing study, less is known about the spatial distribution of landslides in paraglacial settings. Here, we present a landslide inventory for large deglaciated area (\textasciitilde 100,000\,km2) situated within the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) limits of the Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI). Using satellite images and the TanDEM-X digital elevation model, we mapped a total of 15,543 landslides, among which 1006 are deep-seated landslides (DSLs) with area ≥0.01\,km2. The distribution of DSLs is highly asymmetric in a W-E transect of the NPI region, with pronounced clustering along the semi-arid eastern front of the Patagonian Andes. The most strongly affected domain is volcanic tablelands overlying weak Miocene sedimentary rocks, but DSLs tend to also cluster along recently deglaciated (i.e. since the end of the 19th century) eastern margin of the NPI. Compared with other high mountain regions, alpine valleys of the Patagonian Andes are affected by DSLs only in {$<$}1\% of their area, an order of magnitude lower than in other reported deglaciated mountains. The modest incidence of DSLs in the Patagonian Andes is due to dominance of hard granitoid rocks and relatively weak historical seismic activity. We conclude that 1) geological conditions control the distribution of DSLs and their types in the NPI region; 2) paraglacial effects play secondary (although locally important) roles in the origin of DSLs; 3) local clusters of large DSLs originate due to specifics of the post-LGM landscape evolution, involving drawdowns of glacial lakes and incision of rivers into the unconsolidated deposits; and 4) increased abundance of landslides above the recently shrinking margin of the NPI results from the repeated Holocene fluctuations of glacier snouts around the Little Ice Age (LIA) glacier limits and the spatial coincidence of glacial debuttressing effects with the presence of active faults.},

  abstract = {Although deglaciation is one of the crucial factors controlling the stability of slopes in high mountains, the chronological response of rock slope failure (RSF) to glacier retreat still remains poorly known. Here we provide the first cosmogenic (10Be) age constraints on prominent rock avalanches and rockfalls (collectively termed ‘rock slope failures’ – RSFs) from the Tatra Mountains, the highest mountain range with the most pronounced glacier morphology within the Carpathians. Six representative RSFs were selected for surface exposure dating in the mountain range. Two sites are situated in the western part with less pronounced local relief and gentler slope gradient, and four come from the highest eastern part with oversteepened rock slopes. Our dataset also contains the largest known RSF in the Tatra Mountains; the Koprová rock avalanche with a volume of \textasciitilde 5.4 × 106 m3. Based on 26 10Be dated boulders, the weighted mean ages of individual RSF accumulations range between 20.2 ± 1.2 and 10.1 ± 0.3 ka. Our results suggest that smaller, structurally predisposed failures (mainly rockfalls) in the steepest parts of the mountains reacted immediately (i.e. a few hundred years) to deglaciation, whereas more complex slope deformations in terrain with lower local relief, involving the largest rock avalanche in the Tatra Mountains, experienced a substantial time lag (i.e. several millennia) in respect to ice retreat. In the case of delayed RSFs, their origin can be well correlated with warmer and more humid periods in the Lateglacial/early Holocene such as the Bølling–Allerød chronozone and after the onset of the Holocene.},

Four DSGSD-affected ridges in the highest part of the Czech sector of the OWC have been subjected to multidisciplinary investigation involving mapping, structural and kinematic analysis, geoelectrical imaging, trenching and dating. All the studied DSGSDs are strongly predisposed by regional structural fabric given by the intersection of bedding planes, joint sets and faults. Performed research suggests high diversity of mechanisms leading to the origin of individual DSGSDs. The area of a single DSGSD can be affected by various types of movements such as sackung, lateral spreading, toppling or incipient sliding. Electrical imaging and trenching revealed that besides these mechanisms, anisotropic flysch massifs formed by thick-bedded sandstones are strongly exposed to subsurface opening of air-filled voids related to widened crevices. Such a process is driven by deep-seated creep and translational sliding of sandstone beds upon plastic claystones whose strength has been reduced to residual values of the angle of internal friction. Performed radiocarbon and OSL dating revealed that some of the studied DSGSDs originated in the Holocene period, particularly in the Atlantic and Subboreal chronozones.},

A giant landslide arose in the Alma water gap as a reflection of several coincident preparatory factors such as suitable bedrock stratification, smectite-rich bedrock exposed to swelling activity, presence of faults parallel to the valley trend, and river capture event which preceded the landslide event. The occurrence of such ancient megaslides is particularly interesting in the area which is characterized by low precipitation ({$<$}500 mm/year) and weak contemporary seismicity. It probably reflects a more dynamic environment in humid phases of the Holocene; however, seismic triggering along the Mesozoic suture zone cannot be rejected. Compressional features such as gravitational folds in the central and distal parts of the landslide, which probably correlate with the whole landslide genesis or its significant reactivation, arose, according to the radiocarbon dating, during the Holocene climatic optimum in the Atlantic period. The slope deformation has been relatively quiescent since that time, except minor historic reactivization which took place in the frontal part of the landslide. We suppose that the studied landslide could be classified as a transitional type of slope deformation with some signs of spreading and translational block slides.},

  abstract = {Quaternary glaciations have repeatedly shaped large tracts of the Andean foreland. Its spectacular large glacial lakes, staircases of moraine ridges, and extensive outwash plains have inspired generations of scientists to reconstruct the processes, magnitude, and timing of ice build-up and decay at the mountain front. Surprisingly few of these studies noticed many dozens of giant (!108 m3) mass-wasting deposits in the foreland. We report some of the world's largest terrestrial landslides in the eastern piedmont of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS) along the traces of the former Lago Buenos Aires and Lago Puyerredo n glacier lobes and lakes. More than 283 large rotational slides and lateral spreads followed by debris slides, earthflows, rotational and translational rockslides, complex slides and few large rock avalanches detached some 164 ± 56 km3 of material from the slopes of volcanic mesetas, lake-bounding moraines, and rivergorge walls. Many of these landslide deposits intersect with well-dated moraine ridges or former glacial-lake shorelines, and offer opportunities for relative dating of slope failure. We estimate that {$>$}60\% of the landslide volume (\textasciitilde 96 km3) detached after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Giant slope failures crosscutting shorelines of a large Late Glacial to Early Holocene lake (“glacial lake PIS”) likely occurred during successive lake-level drop between \textasciitilde 11.5 and 8 ka, and some of them are the largest hitherto documented landslides in moraines. We conclude that 1) large portions of terminal moraines can fail catastrophically several thousand years after emplacement; 2) slopes formed by weak bedrock or unconsolidated glacial deposits bordering glacial lakes can release extremely large landslides; and 3) landslides still occur in the piedmont, particularly along postglacial gorges cut in response to falling lake levels.},

  abstract = {Large-scale, low-gradient ancient landslides estimated at 5.4–18.9 km2 in area and ∼ 0.2–1.2 km3 in volume have been studied in the northern hilly periphery of the Crimean Mountains (Ukraine). They originated on slopes along wide water gaps of rivers (Belbek, Kacha, Alma and Biyuk–Karasu) crossing the cuestas of the northern foothills. The slopes generally consist of slightly northward tilting Miocene (mainly Sarmatian) limestones overlying weak, clay-rich Lower Neogene–Palaeogene substratum with a significant content of smectite. Although the region is characterised by the least active contemporary morphodynamics within the Crimean Mountains, the landslides which were studied are of the same size or even larger than various types of landslides occupying active geomorphic domains of the highest mountain range in the southernmost part of the peninsula. The landslides are generally a spreading type, but the sliding mechanics were probably very complex, involving toppling, rotational slides, gravitational folding and translational block slides. All the landslides which were studied are located in the vicinity of regional faults and three of them have headscarps aligned along faults. A common feature is also a location close (within several km) to the Mesozoic suture zone which is the most important tectonic feature in the northern periphery of the Crimean Orogene. This suture was formerly classified as aseismic; however, evidence of strong, low-frequency palaeoearthquakes was collected during the last decade within both the Mesozoic suture and the low-lying northern part of the Crimean Peninsula. Radiocarbon dating of deposits associated with the landslides has revealed at least two phases of increased landslide-activity during the Late Glacial chronozone and Holocene epoch. The main landslide phase presumably took place at some time between the Late Glacial and Atlantic chronozones. Minor reactivation of landslide toes occurred during the Subatlantic chronozone and some of them have been active up to recent times. The first major landslide phase was possibly triggered by an earthquake, whereas late Holocene activity can be attributed both to seismic and hydroclimatic factors.},

Catastrophic landslides that occurred during extreme hydrometeorological events in recent decades displayed evidence of Holocene activity. Most of the CFLLs dammed and steepened adjacent valleys.

  abstract = {Moderate-relief landscapes, such as the Czech Flysch Outer Western Carpathians (COWC), in comparison with alpine regions are rarely subject to extensive landslide inventory mapping. An understanding of landslides in such a landscape is needed, because densely populated hilly landscapes in temperate zones are usually of major socio-economic importance. In this study, we performed the first LiDAR-based landslide mapping for the entire COWC area (\textasciitilde 7539 km2), one of the most landslide-prone regions in Europe. By calculating various landscape and landslide metrics, we infer the distribution, frequency-area relationships, kinematics and controls of mass movements with special attention on large landslides (≥0.1 km2) and deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs). We mapped a total of 13,611 landslides, of which 1357 failures are large landslides and DSGSDs. Whereas the lower and more subdued areas in the southern part of COWC are hotspots in terms of the total number of landslides, the higher and more topographically pronounced areas in the northeast are affected predominantly by large landslides and DSGSDs. However, landslides with ≥0.1 km2 are widespread throughout the whole territory of COWC. A discrepancy also exists in the spatial distribution of different types of landslides. Rock slides and DSGSDs are dominant in the north-east, while flow-type landslides are dominant in the southern lower topographic relief with claystone-dominated flysch. We conclude that 1) distinct geological units (nappes) produce landslide populations with different frequency-area distributions; 2) stratigraphic composition alongside the tectonic style of flysch formations control the type of landslides; 3) DSGSDs affect mainly slopes formed by rigid rocks sitting atop soft formations; and 4) geological conditions, rather than topography, control distribution of large landslides and DSGSDs in COWC.},

  abstract = {This study deals with the chronology of the largest long-runout landslide in the northwesterrn part of the Western Flysch Carpathians (Kysucké Beskydy Mts, Slovakia). Despite the impossibility of using direct radiocarbon dating method, time constraints for the evolution of the landslide were determined on the basis of the dating of various sedimentological/geomorphological elements situated on and adjacent to the landslide body. The results show that the landslide evolved between ∼ 10.3 and 9.0 ka 14C BP, i.e. in the wider transitional phase between the Late Glacial (LG) and the Holocene. The main mass movement activity took place at the turn of the Younger Dryas/Preboreal chronozones, whereas retrogressive activity continued up to the Preboreal/Boreal transition. Radiocarbon dating together with pollen analysis and sedimentology of landslide-dammed palaeolakes and colluvial peat bogs revealed almost continuous Holocene palaeogeographical records between ∼ 10.3 and 3.3 ka 14C BP. Periods of enhanced sediment supply to the reservoirs in ∼ 9.9–9.0, ∼ 8.4–8.2, ∼ 6.9–6.5 and ∼ 4.5 ka 14C BP correlate well with palaeogeomorphic and palaeohydrological records from nearby Polish Carpathians. The study confirms that the LG/Holocene transition represented a favourable period for the evolution of large landslides not only in glaciated high mountain areas, but also in medium-high mountains of Central Europe.},

  abstract = {The region of the Flysch Western Carpathians is characterized by abundant deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs). This study deals with a detailed analysis of Late Holocene catastrophic collapse of a fault-created slope of Mountain Ropice in the Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mountains (eastern Czech Republic). The catastrophic collapse was initialized by huge compound rotational slide/toppling deformation which occurs on the upper part of the studied slope and affects tectonically weakened, subhorizontally inclined sandstone beds. Detailed geomorphological mapping accompanied by morphotectonic analysis and geophysical sounding revealed at least two historic flowslides. The older event (F1) affected 0.5–0.8 Mm3 of bedrock and created a 1000-m-long and up to 150-m-wide accumulation with abundant transverse steps and a carapace-like surface. The landslide toe blocked an adjacent valley, which led to the development of a small impoundment with ∼ 4-m-thick deposits containing lacustrine-peat bog, floodplain and alluvial fan facies. Radiocarbon dating and pollen analysis indicate the valley blockage at ∼ 1.5 ka BP. The other flowslide (F2) of much smaller dimensions (10 000–12 000 m3) overlaid the main landslide body and, according to the dating of minerogenic horizon in the impoundment, may have taken place b 0.3 ka BP. The organisation of landforms, character of slope failures and dynamic back-modelling point to a likely rock avalanche (or combined rock slide–debris avalanche) mechanism of movement. This case study shows that rapid rock avalanches can operate also in mountainous terrain with moderate relief if toppling together with deepseated gravitational deformation of slopes modifies the original stable position of bedding planes.},

We present here a detailed study of the sedimentary archive within a landslide-controlled impounded floodplain (Smrdutá site, Czech Flysch Carpathians) using geochronological (14C and 137Cs), sedimentological and pollen evidence. A sedimentary sequence deposited above the landslide dam points to three highly discontinuous and instantaneous depositional events dated to 4.6 and 2.0 cal. ka BP, whereas the last cycle started approximately in the 17–18th centuries and has continued to recent times. Such sedimentary pulses characterized by the duration of several decades to a few centuries originated as a consequence of the blockage and/or reduction of the valley floor width by successive long-runout landslides from a slope formed by tectonically and lithologically anisotropic flysch bedrock. Stages of mass movement activity revealed by the Smrdutá landslide correlate well with major humid late-Holocene oscillations suggesting its high sensitivity to century-scale climatic deteriorations. The character of lithological units forming individual sedimentary pulses, erosional hiatuses and sedimentary traces caused by the July 1997 extreme flood indicate a decisive role of large flood events during accretion and erosion of the floodplainimpounded section.},

  abstract = {Sackungen represents a common mode of deep-seated rock-slope failures in alpine landscapes, but proof of their temporal and causal relationship to extrinsic factors such as climatic changes, glacier retreat or seismic activity remains elusive. Based on the terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) dating of 18 sackung scarps supported by one radiocarbon-dated scarp, we reconstructed the post-glacial chronology of sackungen in the Tatra Mts. (central Europe, Slovakia and Poland), the highest part of the Carpathians. The obtained ages (\textasciitilde 15.7e4.3 ka) indicate that sackungen post-date the regional LGM and some of them originated soon after the glacier withdrawal from adjacent valleys. Furthermore, systematic decrease of scarp ages with their increasing altitude suggests a direct link between sackung origin and post-LGM glacier thinning. However, substantial lag ({$>$}5 ka) of some sackungen in respect to glacier retreat implies complex relationships between sackung onset and deglaciation where retreat of glaciers acted predominantly as a preparatory, not a triggering factor during the genesis of these slope deformations. They originated either as a consequence of stress relaxation within the rock mass lasting several ka or alternatively could be triggered by climatic processes or seismicity. Indeed, a significant part of sackung activity took place during predominantly warmer and more humid periods, with some dates coinciding with the BøllingeAllerød chronozone, but especially with the onset of the Holocene and the Holocene Climatic Optimum. Earthquake triggering is less probable, as the Tatra Mts. lack significant modern and historic seismic activity and there is no geomorphic evidence of fault offsets on the Late Quaternary landforms. In concert with other recent studies, we propose that large rock slope failures in high mountains seldom react immediately to glacier withdrawal, but could display temporal delay lasting up to several millennia.},

The megalandslide has a very gently inclined slip surface (b 5°) and originated in a low-gradient landscape formed by weak, nearly horizontally inclined Miocene limestones overlying clay-rich strata. It is one of the largest documented slope failures in the world originating in low-gradient settings outside of high-relief mountain regions. Field analysis of 22 outcrops within the landslide body and interpretations of a 3″ SRTM digital elevation model and satellite images indicate at least two stages of emplacement. It started as a catastrophic rotational blockslide and turned into an earthflow in the distal part of the landslide. The secondary phase is attributed to a steepening of the landslide toe due to lateral erosion of the Kuban River. As a consequence, multiple rotational collapses of the distal part of the megalandslide occurred. OSL and AMS radiocarbon dating of deformed soil and loess overlying the landslide body suggest possible formation of the megalandslide between \textasciitilde{} 13 and 35 ka BP. Although the trigger of the megalandslide is difficult to establish, we hypothesise that during the slightly moister interval of the Last Glacial, it may have been triggered by an earthquake associated with the rupture of the Late Quaternary Kazminskiy Fault nearby. Fragmented and weakened material from the megalandslide has recently been subjected to intensive denudation by numerous shallow landslides, gully erosion and subsequent aggradation of material on valley floors.},

  abstract = {Giant catastrophic landslides ({$>$}108 m3) dot the formerly glaciated mountain forelands of the eastern Patagonian Andes. From geomorphic mapping, sedimentological logs and radiocarbon dating, we infer the emplacement kinematics and approximate timing of giant landslides in moraines and other glacial deposits in the Lago Pueyrredo n valley (LPV), Argentina. For the first time, we report in detail examples of giant low-gradient landslides with hummocky lobes derived from unconsolidated glacial deposits and weak bedrock. We find that at least 4.5 km3 of debris and weak bedrock were mobilized by slope failures in an area of \textasciitilde 500 km2 since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; \textasciitilde 25e18 ka). Nearly 90\% of this landslide volume originated along the shores of, or as subaqueous failures in, a postglacial moraine-dammed meltwater lake. The larger landslides ({$>$}1 km3) detached from moraines fringing the lake, whereas other landslides displaced glacial and lake deposits either on the paleolake bed, or in a river gorge that was cut upon drainage of the glacial lake. Sequences of till, glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits overlying weak Early Miocene marlstone are mostly conducive to major landslides in the LPV. Crosscutting relationships indicate that largest landslides in the area originated during rapid glacial lakelevel drops. Distribution and internal structure of hummocks within landslide lobes suggest that these landslides were emplaced as catastrophic debris avalanches. It suggests that giant catastrophic landslides in the glacier forelands of Patagonia can result from layered weak rocks, changes in meltwater-lake levels, and possibly as a consequence of strong earthquakes linked to rapid post-glacial rebound following the retreat of the Patagonian Ice Sheet (PIS).},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of high-resolution LiDAR data reveals surprisingly strong topographic evidence of late Quaternary faulting in some intraplate regions characterized by weak recent tectonic activity. For the first time, we present evidence of a N50 km-long post-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) tectonic rupture along the southern margin of the Tatra Mountains (Slovakia) in the highest part of the Carpathian Mountains. Using a highresolution 1 × 1 m LiDAR DEM, we recognize that the normal, range-bounding Sub-Tatra fault (STF) and its eastward branch, the Ružbachy fault (RBF), offset late Quaternary glacial moraines, alluvial fans and colluvial slopes. The fault zone morphology is dominated by a nearly continuous, southward-facing, up to \textasciitilde 18 m-high main scarp locally accompanied by antithetic fault scarps and hanging wall grabens. Similar offsets of pre-LGM and LGM deposits and the absence of fault scarps within Holocene alluvium suggest that the STF and RBF were active for a relatively short time interval between \textasciitilde 18 ka and the Holocene. Using the vertical separation of dated LGM moraine crests, we estimate that the minimum average postglacial slip rates along the STF and RBF varied from \textasciitilde 0.1–0.3 mm/year, i.e., rates one order of magnitude higher than those reported for other faults in Central Europe. Additionally, deep-seated landslides and the presence of large rock avalanches along the fault suggest possible postglacial high-magnitude earthquake(s) producing coseismic rupture of the STF and RBF. We conclude that 1) southern range-bounding faults of the Tatra Mountains are the longest (N50 km) and only documented post-LGM ruptures revealing extensive offset of late Quaternary deposits in the Western Carpathians and 2) relatively small along-strike variations in postglacial offset mimic the long-term exhumation trends and imply “en block” uplift of the southern margin of the Tatra Mountains with the highest displacement along the east STF.},

As a consequence, a multitude of small failures originated 88\% of which was smaller than 104 m2. Most landslides are characterised as shallow ({$<$}10 m) or middle–deep (10–30 m) incipient (rather short travel) landslides, debris slides and soil slips spatially clustered to a geological domain underlain by rather weak thinbedded flysch and unconsolidated Quaternary deposits. An exception to this is represented by a kilometre-long rockslide (∼2–3 mil m3) affecting tectonically weakened and weathered claystone/mudstone-dominated flysch on the southern slope of Mt. Girová (the Beskydy Mountains). The rockslide is one of the largest long runout landslides in the territory of the Czech Republic activated over the past few decades as it reaches the dimensions of the largest documented Holocene long runout landslides in the Czech part of the OWC. A majority of the May 2010 landslide events developed inside older (Holocene or historic) landslide terrains, which points to their spatial persistency and recurrent nature. In spite of the fact that the May 2010 landslide event was not as destructive as some previous landslide activisation in the OWC region (e.g. July 1997 event), it left many slope failures at the initial stage of their potential future reactivation.},

  abstract = {Recent progress of dating techniques has greatly improved the age determination of various types of landslides. Since the turn of the 21st century, the number of dated landslides throughout the world has increased several fold and the introduction of modern dating methods (e.g. cosmic ray exposure dating) has enabled the dating of new landslide features and elements. Based on the analysis of {$>$}950 dated landslides (of which 734 have been dated since the year 2000), it is clear that the predominant traditional strategies have continued to rely on the radiocarbon method; however, there is a remarkable trend of using cosmic ray exposure techniques for dating both the accumulation (e.g. landslide boulders) and the depletion (e.g. landslide scarps) parts of landslides. Furthermore, an increasing number of slope failures is determined by a multi-dating approach, which enables the verification of particular dating methods. Although coherent regional landslide chronologies are still relatively scarce in comparison with extensive databases of fluvial, glacial and/or eolian landforms, they offer important insights into temporal landslide distribution, long-term landslide behavior and their relationships with paleoenvironmental changes. The most extensive data sets exist for the mountain areas of North America (Pacific Coast Ranges), South America (Andes), Europe (Alps, Scottish Highlands, Norway, Carpathians and Apennines), the Himalaya-Tibet orogeny and the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Dated landslides in the plate interiors are lacking, especially in South America, Africa and Australia. Despite the fact that some dating results are well correlated with major regional and continental-scale changes in the seismic activity, moisture abundance, glacier regimes and vegetation patterns, some of these results contradict previously established straightforward hypotheses. This indicates the rather complex chronological behavior of landslides, reflecting both intrinsic (e.g. gradual stress relaxation within a rock mass) and external factors, including high-magnitude earthquakes or heavy rainfalls.},

Although these deformations have been studied since the 1960s, significant insights to the rates of DSGSDs have only been gained within the last two decades owing to progress in geochronology, remote sensing and instrumental monitoring. Absolute age and monitoring data indicate that DSGSD movements are observable over long-term (≥ 102 years) and short-term (b102 years) intervals. Apart from creep, an episodic deformation also plays a crucial role, especially in regions with earthquakes and heavy rainfall. Our review also supports the notion of DSGSDs as precursors of catastrophic rock slope failures, given that many of the world's largest rock avalanches have occurred in areas with diagnostic DSGSD features, indicating that sudden collapse was preceded by a prolonged stage of slope sagging. Detailed studies on DSGSDs have therefore the potential for better prediction of catastrophic rock slides and rock avalanches.},

  abstract = {Over the last several decades, rock mass classification systems have been proposed in order that cuttings at high risk for failure be identified, and preventive measures be effectively prioritized. The present paper attempts a review of the systems in question, illustrating the main differences and similarities among them, which are focused on the types of failures considered and the factors involved. The reliability of these systems is discussed as well. Relatively, these systems contain factors which raise queries about their suitability or the manner by which they are attributed into them. Moreover, although a rock cut failure event presupposes the action of a triggering factor (e.g., earthquake, precipitation), rock mass classification systems, by omitting it, do not classify cuttings according to their actual hazard (potentiality) for failure. Groundwater, when it is not erroneously ignored, is taken into account as instability factor with limited effect upon the systems (o15\%) and not as a triggering factor for failure. Additionally, a number of suggestions regarding rock mass classification systems are given. Relatively, it is recommended rock cuttings to be classified according to their failure hazard taking into account both their condition and the influence of triggering factors upon stability. Moreover, each type of failure should be examined independently, as each one of them is governed by specific instability factors. Finally, some recommendations concerning amalgamation of factors, the possible ways that water may trigger a failure and the quantification of the most common triggering factors for failure (earthquake and precipitation) are provided.},

Tree-ring widths were measured for the upslope and downslope sides of each stem. Events of landslide activity were dated using the method of the eccentricity index. The tree-ring record of landsliding was compared with the occurrence of precipitation in the study area. The nature of the relation between precipitation and landsliding is complex. We have found a statistically significant correlation between landsliding and the number of days with 24-hour precipitation totals above 20 mm and high 3-, 5-, and 10-day precipitation totals during winter half-years. Thus landsliding in the Kamień massif is triggered mainly by high precipitation totals in the preceding winter period. No such relation was found for annual precipitation totals and different types of precipitation totals in the summer period. Single landsliding events related to high summer precipitation totals were found, but the correlation is not statistically significant. In addition some landsliding events are 1–2 years lagged after the occurrence of high long-term precipitation totals. It seems that the strongest landsliding events resulted from sequences of wet summer, wet winter and once again wet summer seasons directly following one another.},

The Slumgullion earthflow is one of the most famous and spectacular landslides in the world; it consists of a younger, active part which moves on and over an older, much larger, inactive part. Total length of the earthflow is 6.8 km, with an estimated volume of 170 × 106 m3. Its nearly constant rate of movement (ranging from about 2 m per year at the head, to a maximum of 6–7 m per year at its narrow and central part, to values between 1.3 and 2 m per year at the active toe), and the geological properties of moving material, are well suited for the observation of the development and evolution of surface features.},

  abstract = {Current models to explain regional-scale landslide events are not able to account for the possible effects of the legacy of previous earthquakes, which have triggered landslides in the past and are known to drive damage accumulation in brittle hillslope materials. This paper tests the hypothesis that spatial distributions of earthquake-induced landslides are determined by both the conditions at the time of the triggering earthquake (time-independent factors) and the legacy of past events (time-dependent factors). To explore this, we undertake an analysis of failures triggered by the 1929 Buller and 1968 Inangahua earthquakes, in the northwest South Island of New Zealand. The spatial extents of landslides triggered by these events were in part coincident. Spatial distributions of earthquake-triggered landslides are determined by a combination of earthquake and local characteristics, which influence the dynamic response of hillslopes. To identify the influence of a legacy from past events, we first use logistic regression to control for the effects of time-independent variables. Through this analysis we find that seismic ground motion, hillslope gradient, lithology, and the effects of topographic amplification caused by ridge- and slope-scale topography exhibit a consistent influence on the spatial distribution of landslides in both earthquakes. We then assess whether variability unexplained by these variables may be attributed to the legacy of past events. Our results suggest that hillslopes in regions that experienced strong ground motions in 1929 were more likely to fail in 1968 than would be expected on the basis of time-independent factors alone. This effect is consistent with our hypothesis that unfailed hillslopes in the 1929 earthquake were weakened by damage accumulated during this earthquake and its associated aftershock sequence, which influenced the behaviour of the landscape in the 1968 earthquake. While our results are tentative, they suggest that the damage legacy of large earthquakes may persist in parts of the landscape for much longer than observed subdecadal periods of post-seismic landslide activity and sediment evacuation. Consequently, a lack of knowledge of the damage state of hillslopes in a landscape potentially represents an important source of uncertainty when assessing landslide susceptibility. Constraining the damage history of hillslopes, through analysis of historical events, therefore provides a potential means of reducing this uncertainty.},

  abstract = {The Vajont landslide is a well-known, reservoir-induced slope failure that occurred on 9 October 1963 and was characterized by an ‘en masse’ sliding motion that triggered various large waves, determining catastrophic consequences for the nearby territory and adjacent villages. During the Vajont dam construction, and especially after the disaster, some researchers identified widespread field evidence of heavy rock mass damage involving the presumed prehistoric rockslide and/or the 1963 failed mass. This paper describes evidence of heavy gravitational damage, including (i) folding, (ii) fracturing, (iii) faulting, and (iv) intact rock disintegration. The gravityinduced rock mass damage (GRMD) characterizes the remnants of the basal shear zone, still resting on the large detachment surface, and the 1963 failed rock mass. The comprehensive geological study of the 1963 Vajont landslide, based on the recently performed geomechanical survey (2006–present) and on the critical analysis of the past photographic documentation (1959–1964), allows us to recognize that most GRMD evidence is related to the prehistoric multistage Mt. Toc rockslide. The 1963 catastrophic en masse remobilization induced an increase to the prehistoric damage, reworking preexisting structures and creating additional gravity-driven features (folds, fractures, faults, and rock fragmentation). The gravity-induced damage was formed during the slope instability phases that preceded the collapse (static or quasi-static GRMD) and also as a consequence of the sliding motion and of the devastating impact between the failed blocks (dynamic GRMD). Gravitational damage originated various types of small drag folds such as flexures, concentric folds, chevron, and kink-box folds, all having a radius of 1–5 m. Large buckle folds (radius of 10–50 m) are related to the dynamic damage and were formed during the en masse motion as a consequence of deceleration and impact processes that involved the sliding mass. Prior to failure, unstable rock slopes can be affected by diffuse newly formed gravity-driven joints that are absent in the surrounding area and within the underlying bedrock, as the Vajont case history demonstrates (joint sets J9 and J10). These fractures, caused by critical tensile and shear stresses, represent an important mechanical clue to recognizing, on a geological basis, the instability condition of a rock slope under investigation. Owing to its complex geological evolution, the Vajont landslide is an outstanding example to help learn about cumulative GRMD effects that can accumulate over time when an ancient rockslide is further remobilized by a sudden en masse sliding motion.},

  abstract = {We compare data from three deep-seated gravitational slope deformations (DSGSDs) where palaeoseismological techniques were applied in artificial trenches. At all trenches, located in metamorphic rocks of the Italian Alps, there is evidence of extensional deformation given by normal movements along slip planes dipping downhill or uphill, and/or fissures, as expected in gravitational failure. However, we document and illustrate – with the aid of trenching – evidence of reverse movements. The reverse slips occurred mostly along the same planes along which normal slip occurred, and they produced drag folds in unconsolidated Holocene sediments as well as the superimposition of substrate rocks on Holocene sediments. The studied trenches indicate that reverse slip might occur not only at the toe portions of DSGSDs but also in their central-upper portions. When the age relationships between the two deformation kinematics can be determined, they clearly indicate that reverse slips postdate normal ones. Our data suggest that, during the development of long-lived DSGSDs, inversion kinematics may occur in different sectors of the unstable rock mass. The inversion is interpreted as due either to locking of the frontal blocks of a DSGSD or to the relative decrease in the rate of downward movement in the frontal blocks with respect to the rear blocks.},

This snowline span of 900 m corresponds roughly to the difference between present-day snowline altitudes and suggested Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) snowline altitudes27. Importantly, although it is representative of the LGM snowline variation in the Bitterroot Range, the snowline interval is not meant to represent the actual LGM snowline lowering for Sierra Nevada, where the real snowline altitude reached only the highest parts of the mountain range during the Quaternary25.

However, due to a lack of understanding about the main predisposing factors influencing their spatial distribution, size and failure mechanisms, the effective impact of GSD on the evolution of the landscape remains difficult to quantify. This study presents the first detailed, regional-scale GSD inventory of the entire Upper Rhone catchment (western Switzerland). The detection and mapping of GSD are performed by combining different remote sensing approaches. Moreover, we propose a detailed characterisation of GSD, taking into account geometry, morphology and failure mechanisms. Based on these analyses, more than 300 GSD are identified, corresponding to 11 \% of the entire study area. Spatial and statistical analyses indicate that GSD are not uniformly distributed across the study area: six GSD clusters are highlighted, containing more than 80 \% of the GSD events detected. Our observations suggest that the distribution of GSDs is primarily related to coexisting active tectonic processes (including high uplift gradients and earthquake activity) and pre-existing regional-scale, tectonic weakness zones. The region’s lithological and structural conditions, on the other hand, appear largely to influence the failure mechanisms and the sizes of the GSD detected.},

The structural features of the eastern face were investigated using a high resolution digital elevation model (HRDEM). According to displacement datasets and structural observations, potential failure mechanisms affecting different portions of the mountain have been assessed. The volumes of the different potentially unstable blocks have been calculated using the Sloping Local Base Level (SLBL) method. Based on the volume estimation, two and three dimensional dynamic runout analyses have been performed. Calibration of this analysis is based on the experience from the adjacent Frank Slide and other similar rock avalanches. The results will be used to improve the contingency plans within the hazard area.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Large slope failures in fractured rocks are often controlled by the combination of pre-existing tectonic fracturing and brittle failure propagation in the intact rock mass during the pre-failure phase. This study focuses on the influence of fold-related fractures and of post-folding fractures on slope instabilities with emphasis on Turtle Mountain, located in SW Alberta (Canada). The structural features of Turtle Mountain, especially to the south of the 1903 Frank Slide, were investigated using a high-resolution digital elevation model combined with a detailed field survey. These investigations allowed the identification of six main discontinuity sets influencing the slope instability and surface morphology. According to the different deformation phases affecting the area, the potential origin of the detected fractures was assessed. Three discontinuity sets are correlated with the folding phase and the others with post-folding movements. In order to characterize the rock mass quality in the different portions of the Turtle Mountain anticline, the geological strength index (GSI) has been estimated. The GSI results show a decrease in rock mass quality approaching the fold hinge area due to higher fracture persistence and higher weathering. These observations allow us to propose a model for the potential failure mechanisms related to fold structures.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to develop a novel hybrid model for assessing landslide susceptibility at the regional scale using multisource data to produce a landslide susceptibility map of the Zigui–Badong area near the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. This area is subject to anthropogenic influences because the reservoir's water level fluctuates cyclically between 145 and 175 m; in addition, the area suffers from extreme rainfall events due to the local climate. The area has experienced significant and widespread landslide events in recent years. In our study, a novel hybrid model is proposed to produce landslide susceptibility maps using geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. The hybrid model is based on rough set (RS) theory and a support vector machine (SVM). RS theory is employed as an attribute reduction tool to identify the significant environmental parameters of a landslide, and an SVM is used to predict landslide susceptibility. Four data domains were considered in this research: geological, geomorphological, hydrology, and land cover. The original group of 20 environmental parameters and 202 landslides were used as the inputs to produce a landslide susceptibility map. According to the map, 19.7\% of the study area was identified as medium- and high-susceptibility zones encompassing 89.5\% of the historical landslides. The results indicate high levels of landslide hazard in and around the main inhabited areas, such as Badong County and other towns, as well as in rural residential areas and transportation areas along the Yangtze River and its tributaries. The predicted map indicates a good correlation between the classified high hazard areas and slope failures confirmed in the field. Furthermore, the quality of the proposed model was comprehensively evaluated, including the degree of model fit, the robustness of the model, the uncertainty associated with the probabilistic estimate, and the model prediction skill. The proposed model was also compared with the general SVM, which demonstrated that the hybrid model has superior prediction skill and higher reliability and confirmed the usefulness of the proposed model for landslide susceptibility mapping at a regional scale.},

Because of the variable composition of such rock masses, the availability of both petrographic and mechanical features of the intact rock is essential in order to carry out geomechanical studies. Starting from the detailed evaluation of the strength and deformability of the intact rock, the GSI method was applied to the Sanremo flysch formation, which is widely outcropping in Western Italy and involved in many engineering projects. It is characterized by both a remarkable lithological heterogeneity and a structural complexity. Petrographic analysis and laboratory tests allowed the definition of the main constituent lithotypes and the identification of their mechanical properties, whereas geomechanical surveys were performed in order to estimate the GSI values and the strong/weak ratio. Based on the frequency of strong and weak layers, a “weighted average” of intact rock values was used in estimating the rock mass parameters. Three main rock mass classes were identified, and a basic engineering geological map of the study area was prepared.},

Many representative hypothetical models of the slopes were created in order to reproduce the conditions in open pit mines, like their geometry and foliated joints with kinematic conditions for buckling failure. Elastic and plastic simulations have been done. Strength and deformability parameters, such as discontinuity stiffness and cohesion, as well as the in situ stress field, are analyzed in order to understand their influence in the buckling failure mechanism in the global open pit mine slopes excavated in phyllites. As studies about this problem are extremely rare, the present research brings important contributions to establish the basic conditions for this kind of failure.},

  abstract = {Robust interpretations of meltwater systems operating during ice sheet decay are integral to reconstructing deglacial patterns and style. Yet over reliance on meltwater landform morphology with limited attention to morpho-sedimentary relationships, and basin-scale geomorphic and stratigraphic context can lead to unreliable geomorphic inversion-based paleo-ice sheet reconstructions. This problem is illustrated by the evolution of Young Lake esker-like ridge (YLER) formed in the Young Lake basin (YLB) on BC's southern Fraser Plateau during decay of the last Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS). We integrate data from digital elevation models, aerial photographs, sedimentary outcrops, water wells and shallow geophysics (ground-penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography). Previous interpretations of YLER as both an esker and an ice-contact, poorly-sorted, stratified deposit emplaced by westerly flowing meltwater, imply an eastward retreating ice margin. Geophysical data from a flat-topped component of YLER reveal slipface and planar-bedded sand and gravel overlying lacustrine sediments, characteristic of a Hjulstrom delta. Eastward-dipping foresets in a Gilbert delta exist at the eastern terminus. Contextually our observations suggest, despite esker-like morphology, YLER was not deposited within a subglacial ice tunnel. Instead, it formed through deposition of subaerial outwash between and/or on dead ice in front of a regionally backwasting ice margin. The complex deglacial evolution of YLB, including a drainage reversal and formation of two glacial lakes, supports northwestward backwasting of the CIS and dead ice within YLB. We conclude that accurate geomorphic inversion of meltwater landforms for deglacial paleo-ice sheet reconstruction requires knowledge of landform-scale morpho-sedimentary relationships and basin-scale geomorphic and stratigraphic context.},

  abstract = {Post-glacial tectonic faults in the eastern Swiss Alps occur as single lineaments, clusters of faults or extensive fault zones consisting of several individual faults aligned along the same trend. The orientation of the faults reflects the underlying lithology and the pre-existing structures (joints, pervasive foliations) within these lithologies. Most post-glacially formed faults in the area around Chur, which undergoes active surface uplift of 1.6 mm/year, trend E – W and cut across Alpine and glacial features such as active screes and moraines. Additionally, there are NNW and ENE striking faults reactivating pervasive Alpine foliations and shear zones. Based on a comparison with the nodal planes of recent earthquakes, E – W striking faults are interpreted as active faults. Because of very short rupture lengths and mismatches of fault location with earthquake distribution, magnitude and abundance, the faults are considered to be secondary faults due to earthquake shaking, cumulative deformation in post- or interseismic periods or creep, and not primary earthquake-related faults. The maximum of recent surface uplift rates coincides with the youngest cooling of the rocks according to apatite fission-track data and is therefore a long-lived feature that extends well into pre-glacial times. Isostatic rebound owing to overthickened crust or to melting of glacial overburden cannot explain the observed surface uplift pattern. Rather, the faults, earthquakes and surface uplift patterns suggest that the Alps are deforming under active compression and that the Aar massif basement uplift is still active in response to ongoing collision.},

  abstract = {We compiled a catalogue of 442 rainfall events with landslides in the Abruzzo, Marche, and Umbria regions, central Italy, between February 2002 and August 2010. For each event, we determined the duration D (in hours) and the cumulated (total) event rainfall E (in mm), using rainfall measurements obtained from a dense network of 150 rain gauges. Landslides were mapped as single points using Google Earth®, and were attributed a level of mapping accuracy P, in four classes (P1 b 1 km2, P10 b 10 km2, P100 b 100 km2, P300 b 300 km2). Using this information, we determined cumulated event rainfall–rainfall duration (ED) thresholds, which are entirely equivalent to rainfall intensity–duration (ID) thresholds, and avoid unnecessary conversions. To determine the ED thresholds, we modified a statistical method first proposed to determine ID thresholds. Adopting a bootstrapping statistical technique, we expanded the method to determine the uncertainty associated with the parameters that define the power law threshold model, and the sensitivity of the thresholds to the number of (D,E) data points in the empirical data set. We determined ED thresholds for 1\% and 5\% exceedance probability levels: (i) for the entire study area, and for the three individual regions in the study area (Abruzzo, Marche, and Umbria); (ii) for three main lithological domains in the study area (post-orogenic sediments, flysch deposits, carbonate rocks); and (iii) for two seasonal periods (May–September, October–April). Comparison of the ED thresholds indicates that the cumulated amount of rainfall necessary to trigger landslides in flysch deposits is larger than in postorogenic sediments and carbonate rocks. However, the ED thresholds for post-orogenic sediments and carbonate rocks were statistically indistinguishable in the study area. Also, the seasonal thresholds were statistically different for rainfall durations shorter than 12 h and longer than 100 h, but were indistinguishable in the range 12b D b 100 h. The results obtained are directly applicable to landslide forecasting based on empirical rainfall thresholds, and have implications for landslide hazard and risk assessment, as well as for landslide erosion and landscape evolution studies, both in the study area and in the neighboring regions.},

  abstract = {The large physiographic variability and the abundance of landslide and rainfall data make Italy an ideal site to investigate variations in the rainfall conditions that can result in rainfall-induced landslides. We used landslide information obtained from multiple sources and rainfall data captured by 2228 rain gauges to build a catalogue of 2309 rainfall events with – mostly shallow – landslides in Italy between January 1996 and February 2014. For each rainfall event with landslides, we reconstructed the rainfall history that presumably caused the slope failure, and we determined the corresponding rainfall duration D (in hours) and cumulated event rainfall E (in mm). Adopting a power law threshold model, we determined cumulated event rainfall–rainfall duration (ED) thresholds, at 5\% exceedance probability, and their uncertainty. We defined a new national threshold for Italy, and 26 regional thresholds for environmental subdivisions based on topography, lithology, land-use, land cover, climate, and meteorology, and we used the thresholds to study the variations of the rainfall conditions that can result in landslides in different environments, in Italy. We found that the national and the environmental thresholds cover a small part of the possible DE domain. The finding supports the use of empirical rainfall thresholds for landslide forecasting in Italy, but poses an empirical limitation to the possibility of defining thresholds for small geographical areas. We observed differences between some of the thresholds. With increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP), the thresholds become higher and steeper, indicating that more rainfall is needed to trigger landslides where the MAP is high than where it is low. This suggests that the landscape adjusts to the regional meteorological conditions. We also observed that the thresholds are higher for stronger rocks, and that forested areas require more rainfall than agricultural areas to initiate landslides. Finally, we observed that a 20\% exceedance probability national threshold was capable of predicting all the rainfallinduced landslides with casualties between 1996 and 2014, and we suggest that this threshold can be used to forecast fatal rainfall-induced landslides in Italy. We expect the method proposed in this work to define and compare the thresholds to have an impact on the definition of new rainfall thresholds for possible landslide occurrence in Italy, and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {The development of progressive failure in slopes is a poorly understood process, and relatively few advances in terms of the mechanics of the development of failure have been made since 1967. However, advances in the understanding of the development of fractures in brittle materials provide new insights into landslide mechanics. In addition, the link between the deformation mechanism and movement type allows interpretation of displacement records to determine the mechanisms acting within a slope. This paper utilizes these insights into deformation processes, combined with ‘‘reinflation’’ stress-path triaxial experiments, to propose a new model for the development of a progressive, first-time failure within a slope. This model is able to explain the development of failure when the factor of safety is greater than unity, the existence of ‘‘Saito’’ linearity (a linear trend when the reciprocal of velocity prior to failure is plotted against time) during tertiary creep, and the development of failures during periods of apparently increasing normal effective stress.},

A global data set of fatalities from nonseismically triggered landslides that resulted in loss of life between A.D. 2004 and 2010 permits for the first time proper quantification of impacts and spatial distributions. In total, 2620 fatal landslides were recorded worldwide during the 7 yr period of the study, causing a total of 32,322 recorded fatalities. These total numbers of landslides and victims are an order of magnitude greater than other data sets have indicated, but analysis of the data suggests that it may still slightly underestimate the true human costs. The majority of human losses occur in Asia, especially along the Himalayan Arc and in China. This geographical concentration dominates the annual landslide cycle, which peaks in the Northern Hemisphere summer months. Finally, numbers of fatalities per event show a fat-tailed power law distribution, with the density of landslides being moderately correlated with the population density on a national basis.},

  abstract = {Results are presented of a sequence of laboratory tests undertaken to elucidate the behaviour of deep-seated landslides. In deep-seated failures deformation has been reported at depths of up to 250 m. In the movement zone, owing to the weight of the overburden and the surrounding stress environment, conventional soil mechanics cannot be used to explain effectively associations between the landslip activity and the deformation mechanisms operating within the moving mass. A series of experiments has been undertaken on London Clay using a high pressure, servohydraulically controlled triaxial deformation system, to replicate the stresses acting at the base of a large, deep-seated landslide. A number of tests were undertaken, the most significant focusing on the transition between ductile and brittle behaviour. Although sediments usually behave in a brittle manner at low effective stresses (common to many geomorphological studies) and in a ductile manner at high effective stresses, the results presented here identify for the first time in mudrocks a transitional phase of behaviour in which creep-like movement will manifest itself at the base of a deep-seated landslide as the growth of microcracks. The microcracks may eventually coalesce to form a shear surface, a consequence of which is likely to be sudden failure. The results thus have important implications in the understanding of movement mechanisms in large, deep-seated failures, rates of displacement and how they may change through time. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {An improved concept of the best analogs method is used to reconstruct the climate of the last glacial maximum from pollen data in Europe. In order to deal with the lack of perfect analogs of fossil assemblages and therefore to obtain a more accurate climate reconstruction, we used a combination of pollen types grouped according to plant phenology and present climate constraints rather than pollen percentages for each individual taxon. The distribution of pollen taxa into plant functional types (PFTs) is aimed to reflect the vegetation in terms of biomes which have a wider distribution than a species. The climatic variables are then calibrated on these PFTs using an artificial neural network technique. The use of PFTs allowed us to deal with situations where pollen assemblages have only partial modern analogs. The method is applied to the glacial steppic vegetation in Europe, using 15 pollen records. North of the Pyrenees–Alps line, the reconstructed temperatures were lower than today: −30 ± 10°C for the temperature of the coldest month (Tc) and −12 ± 3°C for the annual mean (Tann). South of that line,TcandTannanomalies were respectively, −15 ± 5°C and −10 ± 5°C.

In Italy and Greece, the available moisture was 20\% lower, with a precipitation anomaly of ca. −600 ± 200 mm.

  abstract = {The archetypal badass is individualistic, non-conformist, and able to produce disproportionate results. The badass concept is applied here to geomorphology. The individualistic concept of landscape evolution (ICLE) is introduced, based on three propositions: excess evolution space, capacity of all landforms to change, and variable selection pressure from environmental factors within and encompassing landscapes. ICLE indicates that geomorphic systems are idiosyncratic to some extent, and that even where two systems are similar, this is a happenstance of similar environmental selection, not an attractor state. As geomorphic systems are all individualistic, those that are also non-conformist with respect to conventional wisdoms and have amplifier effects are considered badass. Development of meander bends on a section of the Kentucky River illustrates these ideas. The divergence of karst and fluvial forms on the inner and outer bends represents unstable amplifying effects. The divergence is also individualistic, as it can be explained only by combining general laws governing surface and subsurface flow partitioning with a specific geographical and environmental setting and the history of Quaternary downcutting of the Kentucky River. Landscape evolution there does not conform to any conventional theories or conceptual frameworks of geomorphology. The badass traits of many geomorphic systems have implications for the systems themselves, attitudes toward geomorphic practice, and appreciation of landforms. Badass geomorphology and the ICLE reflect a view, and approach to the study of, landforms as the outcome of the interplay of general laws, place-specific controls, and history. Badass geomorphology also implies a research style receptive to contraventional wisdoms. Aesthetically, amplifier effects and individualism guarantee an essentially infinite variety of landforms and landscapes that geoscientists can appreciate both artistically and scientifically. Non-conformity makes the interpretation and understanding of this variety more challenging – and while that increases the degree of difficulty, it also makes for more interesting and compelling professional challenges.

However, some studies in forest settings have found more varied development patterns, including persistence of states dominated by biogeomorphic feedbacks. In this study we investigated this phenomenon In Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated forests on the main ridge of the Šumava Mountains in the Czech Republic along the German and Austrian borders. Throughout most of the Holocene, Picea has strongly influenced microtopography and soil/regolith characteristics so as to inhibit hydrological connectivity and development of surface drainage, and maintain hydromorphic soil conditions. These strongly historically and geographically contingent ecosystem engineering effects create and maintain habitat that favors spruce over other trees. These interactions have maintained a landscape dominated by biogeomorphic feedbacks.},

These two parameters look at the source complexity from different perspectives: M0 is a static measure of the earthquake size, whereas Er is related to the rupture kinematics and dynamics. For practical applications and for dissemination purposes, the logarithms of M0 and Er are used to define the moment magnitude Mw and the energy magnitude ME, respectively. The introduction of Mw and ME partially obscure the complementarity of M0 and Er. The reason is due to the assumptions needed to define any magnitude scale. For example, in defining Mw, the apparent stress (i.e., the ratio between M0 and Er multiplied by the rigidity) was assumed to be constant, and under this condition, Mw and ME values would only differ by an offset which, in turn, depends on the average apparent stress of the analysed dataset. In any case, when the apparent stress is variable and, for example, scales with M0, the value of ME derived from Mw cannot be used to infer Er.},

  abstract = {Topography of various types and scales can be fingerprinted by computer analysis of altitude matrices (digital elevation models, or DEMs). The critical analytic tool is the geometric signature, a set of measures that describes topographic form well enough to distinguish among geomorphically disparate landscapes. Different surficial processes create topography with diagnostic forms that are recognizable in the field. The geometric signature abstracts those forms from contour maps or their DEMs and expresses them numerically. This multivariate characterization enables once-intractable problems to be addressed. The measures that constitute a geometric signature express different but complementary attributes of topographic form. Most parameters used here are statistical estimates of central tendency and dispersion for five major categories of terrain geometry; altitude, altitude variance spectrum, slope between slope reversals, and slope and its curvature at fixed slope lengths. As an experimental application o f geometric signatures, two mapped terrain types associated with different processes of shallow landsliding in Marin County, California, were distinguished consistently by a 17-variable description of topography from 21 x 21 DEMs (30-m grid spacing). The small matrix is a statistical window that can be used to scan large DEMs by computer, thus potentially automating the mapping of contrasting terrain types. The two types in Matin County host either (1) slow slides: earth flows and slump-earth flows, or (2) rapid flows: debris avalanches and debris flows. The signature approach should adapt to terrain taxonomy and mapping in other areas, where conditions differ from those in Central California.},

Due to the characteristics of the moving material (i.e. rock, debris, ice, snow) and the path of propagation (e.g. presence of a glacier), the mass was able to rapidly cover long distances (about 3000~m). Among the possible causes of the event, attention is mainly focused on permafrost degradation and changes in glacier extension due to global warming. In the present work, the dynamics of the event and the role played by characteristics of the propagation path are numerically investigated with the RASH3D code, based on a continuum mechanics approach. Results obtained with two rheological hypotheses (Frictional and Voellmy) are compared and discussed. In particular, it emerges that 1) the use of a Voellmy rheology with a reduced friction angle on the glacier is necessary to reproduce the dynamics of the Thurwieser event, and 2) a lack in knowledge of geometrical and geomechanical information may lead to wrong interpretations of the event and inaccurate calibration of numerical models.},

The higher spatial and radiometric resolutions of these imagery enable high quality surface extraction over the low-contrast ice sheet surface. The DEMs are registered to satellite radar and laser altimetry and are mosaicked to provide a continuous surface covering nearly the entire continent. The mosaic includes an error estimate and a time stamp, enabling change measurement. Typical elevation errors are less than 1 meter, as validated by the comparison to airborne laser altimetry. REMA provides a powerful new resource for Antarctic science and provides a proof of concept for generating high resolution, accurate, repeat topography at continental scales.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Some of the largest mass movements in the Alps cluster spatially in the Tyrol (Austria). Fault-related valley deepening and coalescence of brittle discontinuities structurally controlled the progressive failure and the kinematics of several slopes. To evaluate the spatial and temporal landslide distribution, a first comprehensive compilation of dated mass movements in the Eastern Alps has been made. At present, more than 480 different landslides in the Tyrol and its surrounding areas, including some 120 fossil events, are recorded in a GIS-linked geodatabase. These compiled data show a rather continuous temporal distribution of landslide activities, with (i) some peaks of activity in the early Holocene at about 10 500\&amp;ndash;9400 cal BP and (ii) in the Tyrol a significant increase of deep-seated rockslides in the Subboreal at about 4200\&amp;ndash;3000 cal BP. The majority of Holocene mass movements were not directly triggered by deglaciation processes, but clearly took a preparation of some 1000 years, after ice withdrawal, until slopes collapsed. In view of this, several processes that may promote rock strength degradation are discussed. After the Late-Glacial, slope stabilities were affected by stress redistribution and by subcritical crack growth. Fracture propagating processes may have been favoured by glacial loading and unloading, by earthquakes and by pore pressure fluctuations. Repeated dynamic loading, even if at subcritical energy levels, initiates brittle fracture propagation and thus substantially promotes slope instabilities. Compiled age dating shows that several landslides in the Tyrol coincide temporally with the progradation of some larger debris flows in the nearby main valleys and, partially, with glacier advances in the Austrian Central Alps, indicating climatic phases of increased water supply. This gives evidence of elevated pore pressures within the intensely fractured rock masses. As a result, deep-seated gravitational slope deformations are induced by complex and polyphase interactions of lithological and structural parameters, morphological changes, subcritical fracture propagation, variable seismic activity and climatically controlled groundwater flows.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {One of the largest mass movements in the Alps, the fossil Fernpass rockslide in the Northern Calcareous Alps (Tyrol, Austria), was dated absolutely for the first time. Three independent radiometric dating methods were applied to geologically individual sample sites and enabled a cross-checking of the results. Close to the scarpfront, rockslide-dammed torrent deposits indicate a 14C minimum age of at least 3380–3080 cal. yrs BP. The chronostratigraphic base of this backwater sequence has not been dated yet, but is assumed to date somewhat older into the middle Holocene. However, this coincides with two cosmogenic radionuclide 36Cl ages of sliding planes at the steep and rugged scarp. Exposure data thus obtained are 3400 ± 900 and 4800 ± 1200 yrs respectively with an arithmetic mean of 4100 ± 1300 yrs. Additional age data were acquired from post-depositional calcareous cements, which locally lithified the rockslide debris. These meteoric cements contain remarkably high Uranium total contents and yielded a 230Th/234U minimum age of about 4150 ± 100 yrs for the accumulation of the rockslide deposits. All dating data agree well and indicate that the Fernpass rockslide is of Subboreal age. Thus the intensively structured present morphology, characterised by the well-known cone-shaped Toma-hills and several lakes in the depressions, is indicative of primary rockslide morphology and clearly not shaped by late-glacial ice as assumed formerly.},

  abstract = {Erosion by glacial and fluvial processes shapes mountain landscapes in a long-recognized and characteristic way. Upland valleys incised by fluvial processes typically have a V-shaped cross-section with uniform and moderately steep slopes, whereas glacial valleys tend to have a U-shaped profile with a changing slope gradient. We present a novel regional approach to automatically differentiate between fluvial and glacial mountain landscapes based on the relation of multi-scale curvature and drainage area. Sample catchments are delineated and multiple moving window sizes are used to calculate per-cell curvature over a variety of scales ranging from the vicinity of the flow path at the valley bottom to catchment sections fully including valley sides. Single-scale curvature can take similar values for glaciated and non-glaciated catchments but a comparison of multi-scale curvature leads to different results according to the typical cross-sectional shapes. To adapt these differences for automated classification of mountain landscapes into areas with V- and U-shaped valleys, curvature values are correlated with drainage area and a new and simple morphometric parameter, the Difference of Minimum Curvature (DMC), is developed. At three study sites in the western United States the DMC thresholds determined from catchment analysis are used to automatically identify 5×5km quadrats of glaciated and non-glaciated landscapes and the distinctions are validated by field-based geological and geomorphological maps. Our results demonstrate that DMC is a good predictor of glacial imprint, allowing automated delineation of glacially and fluvially incised mountain landscapes.},

  abstract = {One of the most fundamental insights for understanding how landscapes evolve is based on determining the extent to which topography was shaped by glaciers or by rivers. More than 104 years after the last major glaciation the topography of mountain ranges worldwide remains dominated by characteristic glacial landforms such as U-shaped valleys, but an understanding of the persistence of such landforms is lacking. Here we use digital topographic data to analyse valley shapes at sites worldwide to demonstrate that the persistence of U-shaped valleys is controlled by the erosional response to tectonic forcing. Our findings indicate that glacial topography in Earth’s most rapidly uplifting mountain ranges is rapidly replaced by fluvial topography and hence valley forms do not reflect the cumulative action of multiple glacial periods, implying that the classic physiographic signature of glaciated landscapes is best expressed in, and indeed limited by, the extent of relatively low-uplift terrain.},

  abstract = {Deep-seated  landslides  (DSLs)  involve  large-scale  deformation  and  likely  affect  transportation  infrastructure.  Movement rates are in general very slow (less than a metre per year) with acceleration periods controlled by external factors such  as the seasonal fluctuation of groundwater pressure. Acceleration response may change from season to season depending on  hydrogeological conditions, changes in slope geometry and degradation of geological materials. More localized landslide types  are associated with and develop within DSLs, such as rock falls, topples and debris slides. Management of hazards related to  DSLs requires first the assessment of geological, hydrogeological and geomechanical processes. This is the starting point for  developing a management strategy. This paper presents the characterization of a deep-seated landslide located in the Swiss Jura  Mountains, Les Buges landslide, where a railway line, a power line and an aqueduct of regional importance cross the slide, as  well as a highly frequented hiking trail beneath the landslide toe. Slide kinematics is governed by the geology and hydrogeology  of  the  slope,  which  can  be  subdivided  into  two  dominant  bodies.  A  management  strategy  is  subsequently  discussed  for  this  DSL.  Les  Buges  is  a  good  example  illustrating  that  hazards  related  to  deep-seated  landslides  must  be  tackled  first  of  all  by  means of the observational method.},

Dormant landslides are widespread in the region and some of these dormant landslides have been reactivated by human activity such as highway construction, suburban development, or building of industrial sewage pipes. The investigated landslide was reactivated by heavy rainfall events in the late 1990s. During this reactivation an existing industrial sewage pipe was damaged and the chemically loaded waste water drained into the landslide mass. The current landslide movement is assumed to be heavily influenced by the additional water supply as well as by the chemical activity of univalent ions in the clay fraction leading to a decreased shear resistance. Consequently, the movement-triggering rainfall thresholds are reduced and result in a decreased overall slope stability.},

Fluid inclusion (FI) data from carbonate cataclastic rocks occurring at the nappe sole provided useful information about the p-T conditions during the nappe transport. The crucial phenomena considered for formulation of our evolutionary model are: (1) the nappe was derived from a broad rifted basinal area bounded by elevated domains; (2) the nappe body is composed of alternating, rheologically very variable sedimentary rock complexes, hence creating a mechanically stratified multilayer; (3) presence of soft strata serving as décollement horizons; (4) stress and strain gradients increasing towards the backstop; (5) progressive internal deformation at very low-grade conditions partitioned into several deformation stages reflecting varying external constraints for the nappe movement; (6) a very weak nappe sole formed by cataclasites indicating fluid-assisted nappe transport during all stages; (7) injection of hot overpressured fluids from external sources (deformed basement units) facilitating frontal ramp overthrusting under supralithostatic conditions. It was found that no simple mechanical model can be applied, but that all known principal emplacement mechanisms and driving forces temporarily participated in progressive structural evolution of the nappe. The rear compression operated during the early stages, when the sedimentary succession was detached, shortened and transported over the frontal ramp. Subsequently, gravity spreading and gliding governed the final nappe emplacement over the unconstrained basinal foreland.},

  abstract = {Soils in the Amazon Basin are deficient in phosphorus, essential to soil fertility. Previous studies suggested that African mineral dust deposited to Amazonian soils served as an important source of phosphorus that enhances soil fertility. These studies lacked the quantitative measurements essential to validate estimates. Here we present daily measurements of mineral dust and PM10 carried in the trade winds at Cayenne, French Guiana, during 2002–2017. MERRA-2 model dust concentrations showed excellent agreement with measurements over this period. Consequently, we used MERRA-2 to estimate temporal and spatial deposition rates to Amazonia. Our annual deposition rate, 8–10 Tg dust, is substantially lower than previous estimates. Deposition rates are greatest over the northern and northeastern regions of South America. In contrast, rates are low in central Amazonia. Our results raise questions about the impact of African dust on soil fertility in Amazonia. However, African aerosol transport carries other aerosol species that could play a role in soil fertility, including biomass-burning products known to contain substantial concentrations of phosphorus. Our study highlights the need for more measurements of aerosol and precipitation chemistry over wider expanses of South America in order to better characterize aerosol chemical and physical properties, to identify aerosol sources, and to constrain model estimates. We show that over 2002–2017 dust transport to South America was negatively correlated to rainfall over the Sahel in North Africa. Long-term monitoring is needed to capture changes in transport from Africa that might occur as a result of climate change.},

  abstract = {For documenting recent or Late Quaternary erosion rates at the scale of a small watershed, or even an entire mountain range, the use of in-situ terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCN), such as 10Be, in river sediments has become widespread over the last decade. In mountainous settings, however, landslides may induce a two-fold complication in the cosmogenic nuclide budget. First, they may episodically deliver large amounts of sediment with low TCN concentrations to the river channel. Second, they may generate a grain-size-concentration dependence in these sediments. However, studies that have explored grain-size dependence in landslide-dominated areas have reached differing conclusions and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study focuses on the Khudi Khola river basin, a small drainage basin in the central Himalayas. The area is characterized by steep slopes, heavy rainfall, and high sediment production rates. Importantly, the watershed contains a large area of active landsliding. In-situ 10Be was analyzed in sediments of grain sizes ranging from 75μm to \textasciitilde 4cm, collected from five locations: upstream, downstream, and in the small tributaries which drain the landslides. In all sampling locations, including those situated upstream of the landslides, the finest grains (75–250μm) are two to four times more concentrated in 10Be than the largest clasts ({$>$}4.7mm). We developed a numerical slope model which includes a low level of background soil erosion and episodic denudation from large mass-wasting events. We then introduced a coarsening of average grain-size with soil-depth to the model. Our simulation shows that the data available for this valley are compatible with a scenario in which landslides deliver coarse grains to the channel that are less concentrated in TCN and have deeper provenance. Best-fit estimates of the model parameters suggest recurrence times of 3000 to 9000years for a major landslide on the same slope, and mean long-term landslide denudation rates of 1.7 to 4.7mmyr−1. A negative correlation between TCN concentration and grain-size is also observed directly upstream and 5-km downstream of the landsliding area, suggesting that nearly all of the sediment carried by the river is derived from ancient landslides while almost no sediment is supplied by erosion of soil-mantled slopes. Despite these complications, apparent denudation rates directly derived from the TCN concentrations, and from previously published data in the region, are all on the same order of magnitude, around \textasciitilde 2mmyr−1. However, a factor-of-three variability remains between the different studies, depending on the location, the year of sampling and the analyzed grain size fraction. Thus, although TCN-derived average denudation rates provide a useful first order estimate, even in fast-eroding terrains dominated by landslides, caution should be applied when using quantitative results in such settings.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In this study, we validate and compare elevation accuracy and geomorphic metrics of satellite-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) on the southern Central Andean Plateau. The plateau has an average elevation of 3.7 km and is characterized by diverse topography and relief, lack of vegetation, and clear skies that create ideal conditions for remote sensing. At 30 m resolution, SRTM-C, ASTER GDEM2, stacked ASTER L1A stereopair DEM, ALOS World 3D, and TanDEM-X have been analyzed. The higher-resolution datasets include 12 m TanDEM-X, 10 m single-CoSSC TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X DEMs, and 5 m ALOS World 3D. These DEMs are state of the art for optical (ASTER and ALOS) and radar (SRTM-C and TanDEM-X) spaceborne sensors. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} We assessed vertical accuracy by comparing standard deviations of the DEM elevation versus 307 509 differential GPS measurements across 4000 m of elevation. For the 30 m DEMs, the ASTER datasets had the highest vertical standard deviation at \&gt; 6.5 m, whereas the SRTM-C, ALOS World 3D, and TanDEM-X were all \&lt; 3.5 m. Higher-resolution DEMs generally had lower uncertainty, with both the 12 m TanDEM-X and 5 m ALOS World 3D having \&lt; 2 m vertical standard deviation. Analysis of vertical uncertainty with respect to terrain elevation, slope, and aspect revealed the low uncertainty across these attributes for SRTM-C (30 m), TanDEM-X (12–30 m), and ALOS World 3D (5–30 m). Single-CoSSC TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X 10 m DEMs and the 30 m ASTER GDEM2 displayed slight aspect biases, which were removed in their stacked counterparts (TanDEM-X and ASTER Stack). {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Based on low vertical standard deviations and visual inspection alongside optical satellite data, we selected the 30 m SRTM-C, 12–30 m TanDEM-X, 10 m single-CoSSC TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, and 5 m ALOS World 3D for geomorphic metric comparison in a 66 km\textsuperscript{2} catchment with a distinct river knickpoint. Consistent \emph{m}∕\emph{n} values were found using chi plot channel profile analysis, regardless of DEM type and spatial resolution. Slope, curvature, and drainage area were calculated and plotting schemes were used to assess basin-wide differences in the hillslope-to-valley transition related to the knickpoint. While slope and hillslope length measurements vary little between datasets, curvature displays higher magnitude measurements with fining resolution. This is especially true for the optical 5 m ALOS World 3D DEM, which demonstrated high-frequency noise in 2–8 pixel steps through a Fourier frequency analysis. The improvements in accurate space-radar DEMs (e.g., TanDEM-X) for geomorphometry are promising, but airborne or terrestrial data are still necessary for meter-scale analysis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The paper describes the application of geophysical prospecting techniques for estimation of the fault’s inclination. The field survey was carried out across the Muráň fault structure in the Slovenské rudohorie Mts (central Slovakia). Three different geophysical methods were used to map the fault zone: Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), induced polarization (IP) and radon emanometry. All these methods have been used to locate the fault zone area, but the principal aims of this research are to test the efficiency of the 2D ERT technique to recognize the geometrical characterization of the fault and to improve our tectonic knowledge of the investigated area. For the synthetic cases, three geometric contexts were modelled at 60, 90 and 120 degrees and computed with the l2 norm inversion method, the l1 norm with standard horizontal and vertical roughness filter and the l1 norm with diagonal roughness filter. In the second phase this geophysical methodology was applied to fieldwork data. Our results confirm that the ERT technique is a valuable tool to image the fault zone and to characterize the general geometry, but also the importance of setting up the right inversion parameters. The main contribution of the geophysical investigations in this case was the determination of the location and confirmation of the inclination of the Muráň fault. The result of this study is the ability to make a visual estimation of the direction and dip of the fault. Pursuant to this work the dipole—dipole electrode configuration produces the best resolution, particularly for the location of vertical and dipping structures. The advantage of this array is that it shows the ability to assess the trend of the dip and therefore it can be strongly recommended. The result is also a case study of a small scale tectonic survey involving geophysical methods.},

However, the failure of large complex landslides along the fault zone and the causes of their complex geomorphic characteristics are unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the fault zone and the spatial distribution, direction of movement, and geomorphic characteristics of large landslides. We inventoried 29 large landslides in the middle reaches of the Bailong River and described their characteristics. Statistical analysis revealed differences in the spatial relationship between the faults and landslides of different scales. Almost all of the landslide bodies with an area\,{$>$}\,1\,km2 are distributed on the faults; in addition, the strike of the faults was found to constrain the direction of movement of the landslides to the WNW-ESE direction. Statistical results show that the cross sections of landslides in the study area are asymmetric arc, corresponding to which there are significant differences in the geomorphological characteristics of the north and south sides of landslides. The geometric characteristics, physical properties (i.e., material weakness) of the fault zone and rapid uplift of the hanging wall were responsible for the asymmetric shape of landslide cross sections and the geomorphic difference. We present a conceptual model based on the relationship between the fault zone and landslides, which facilitates an improved understanding of the relationship between the fault zone and landslide evolution.},

Spreading appears to take place by movement along disconnected planes and/or by slow plastic deformation of a rock mass. In some places, valleyward squeezing out of weak shales overlain by rigid rocks causes extensional fracturing and outward movement of the rigid layers, as illustrated by extension of two laccoliths overlying Mancos Shale, one at Dolores Peak and another at Crested Butte in western Colorado. Gravitational forces acting on a ridge of more homogeneous material causes tensional spreading of the ridge parallel to its long axis, for example in fractured granitic rock north of Mt. Massive in central Colorado, where a survey course has been established to monitor the movement. Recognition and understanding of these large-scale gravitational features and the mechanism that causes them are pertinent to site selection and design of engineering structures in high mountains. If fractures extend to considerable depth and if movement is continuing, engineering structures in valleys or tunnels through the spreading ridges could be damaged.},

  abstract = {Historical documentary sources from two regions with contrasting historical and social development were examined for information about landslide occurrence and characteristics. The archive search was complemented with limited field work to acquire information about the degree of recent landslide activity and land use. The results from two study areas (Ústí nad Labem in North Bohemia and Zlín in East Moravia) show considerable differences in the types of historical documentary source, their availability and the information they record. It is concluded that local newspapers that include special sections focusing on regional events are the best data sources for the landslide study. The reliability of the acquired historical landslide occurrence frequencies is generally not very good, but it does show notable regional differences caused by not only the availability of documentary sources but also the dynamics of the natural processes responsible for the landslide events. A reconstruction of the landslide activity during the last 70 or more years was carried out for selected sites. The reconstruction showed that the occurrence of historical landslides is only rarely respected in recent land use within both studied urban areas. Historical landslide information could be well used for site-specific landslide hazard assessment. Nevertheless, the use of this information to construct a historical landslide database on the regional or country level is limited only to certain regions of the Czech Republic.

  abstract = {The Pieniny Klippen Belt represents a 600-km-long but only a few kilometers wide suture zone in the Carpathian erogenic belt. Based on a quantitative analysis along a part of its NW-trending segment in northeastern Slovakia, we present structural data supporting transpression, the continuous interaction of strike-slip shearing, horizontal shortening, and vertical lengthening, as a major deformation style in its polyphase deformation history. Dextral transpression is expressed in the map scale and outcrop fault pattern, the oblique orientation of fold axes to the faults bounding the Klippen Belt, and extension parallel to the fold axes. The transpression-related strain field is described and quantified by the analysis of: (1) orientation of rotated fold axes (displaying an acute angle to the margins of the Klippen Belt); (2) orientation and geometry of paleostress derived from mesoscale fault-striae analysis (E-trend of as-trajectories and flattening geometry); and (3) the deformation history indicated by extension veins (non-coaxial regime). Different techniques using fault-striae data quantify paleostress and subdivide heterogeneous data sets mathematically into homogeneous subsets. The observed deformation history is modelled as a homogeneous transpression deformation. The best-fitting model requires a NW-trending (present-day orientation) external contraction direction (e.g., plate-slip vector), and predicts 16\% fold axes parallel extension and 23\% axial plane normal shortening.},

By comparing old, recent and new photographs, in addition to geomorphological field data, we propose an inventory of the rockfalls that occurred since the end of the ‘Little Ice Age’ on the north side of the Aiguilles de Chamonix (Mont Blanc massif), ranging in volume from 500 to 65 000 m3. These 42 rockfalls occurred after 1947, of which {$>$} 70\% during the last two decades, with a maximal frequency during the warm summers, especially in 2003. Average elevation of scars (3130 m a.s.l.) close to the lower modelled permafrost limit, and the topography (e.g. spurs) of the affected rock faces enhancing lateral heat fluxes, suggest that a climatically driven permafrost degradation has triggered many of the recent rockfalls in high-Alpine steep rockwalls.},

  abstract = {Mapping complex landslides under forested terrain requires an appropriate quality of digital terrain models (DTMs), which preserve small diagnostic features for landslide classification such as primary and secondary scarps, cracks, and displacement structures (flow-type and rigid-type). Optical satellite imagery, aerial photographs and synthetic aperture radar images are less effective to create reliable DTMs under tree coverage. Here, we utilized a very high density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, with a point density of 140 points m−2 for generating a high quality DTM for mapping landslides in forested terrain in the Barcelonnette region, the Southern French Alps. We quantitatively evaluated the preservation of morphological features and qualitatively assessed the visualization of ALS-derived DTMs. We presented a filter parameterization method suitable for landslide mapping and compared it with two default filters from the hierarchical robust interpolation (HRI) and one default filter from the progressive TIN densification (PTD) method. The results indicate that the vertical accuracy of the DTM derived from the landslide filter is about 0.04 m less accurate than that from the PTD filter. However, the landslide filter yields a better quality of the image for the recognition of small diagnostic features as depicted by expert image interpreters. Several DTM visualization techniques were compared for visual interpretation. The openness map visualized in a stereoscopic model reveals more morphologically relevant features for landslide mapping than the other filter products. We also analyzed the minimal point density in ALS data for landslide mapping and found that a point density of more than 6 points m− 2 is considered suitable for a detailed analysis of morphological features. This study illustrates the suitability of high density ALS data with an appropriate parameterization for the bare-earth extraction used for landslide identification and characterization in forested terrain.},

Similar trends are observed for the 20th Century in all regions of Switzerland. The general rise in temperature in a region of permafrost may also play a role in the response of slope stability to extreme precipitation. At the foot of the Ritigraben, warming trends of both minimum and maximum temperatures have been particularly marked in the last two decades.},

  abstract = {Mass movement can be activated by earthquakes, rapid snowmelt, or intense rainstorms in conjunction with gravity. Whereas mass movement plays a major role in the evolution of a hillslope by modifying slope morphology and transporting material from the slope to the valley, it is also a potential natural hazard. Determining the relationships of frequency and magnitude of landslides are fundamental to understanding the role of landslides in the study of landscape evolution, hazard assessment, and determination of the rate of hillslope denudation. We mapped 735 shallow and active landslides in the Paonia to McClure Pass area of western Colorado from aerial photographs and field surveys. The study area covers ∼815km2. The frequency–magnitude relationships of the landslides illustrate the flux of debris by mass movement in the area. The comparison of the probability density of the landslides with the double Pareto curve, defined by power scaling for negative slope (α), power scaling for positive slope (β), and location of rollover (t), shows that α=1.1, β=1.9, and t=1,600m2 for areas of landslides and α=1.15, β=1.8, and t=1,900m3 for volumes of landslides. The total area of landslides is 4.8×106m2 and the total volume of the landslides is 1.4×107m3. The areas (A) and the volumes (V) of landslides are related by V=0.0254×A1.45. The frequency–magnitude analysis shows that landslides with areas ranging in size from 1,600 to 20,000m2 are the most hazardous landslides in the study area. These landslides are the most frequent and also do a significant amount of geomorphic work. We also developed a conceptual model of hillslope development to upland plateau driven by river incision, shallow landsliding, and deep-seated large landsliding. The gentle slope to flat upland plateau that dominated the Quaternary landscape of the study area was modified to the present steep and rugged topography by the combined action of fluvial incision and glacial processes in response to rock uplift, very-frequent shallow landsliding, and less-frequent deep-seated landsliding.},

  abstract = {Mugling–Narayanghat road section in Nepal has suffered from a variety of slope failure including rockslides, rock topples, debris slide/flow, and some combination of these. Based on the prominent type of failure, the highway can be divided into three sections (a) Ch10 to Ch17 (dominated by shallow landslides and debris slides/flows), (b) Ch17 to Ch28 (dominated by large-scale, deep-seated landslides), and (c) Ch28 to Ch35 (dominated by rock topples). Rock topples are frequently observed along the highway, mainly on both the limbs of Jalbire Syncline as well as at the upstream of Maure Khola and some in Siwaliks. Slates, phyllites, quartzite, amphibolite and sandstones are affected by these topples. The Maure Khola landslide that is highly affected by rock toppling falls in Nourpoul Formation and consists of amphibolite, quartzite, and slate/phyllite. It lies at the upper reach of the Simaltal Thrust. Steep slopes characterize the upper slope, whose base is covered by thick debris forming a huge debris fan. According to the selected methodological approaches, data from detailed geological, geomorphological and geomechanical surveys, it is clear that these topples are mainly related to the geological structures of the region. Additionally, the landslide contains several sheared zones where the rocks are considerably weathered. These sheared zones act as the sliding plane. Also, the debris fan at the lower part suggests that the landslide has been reactivated several times in the past. Furthermore, it is seen that flexural toppling occurs in weak, mica-rich slate/phyllite at the upper slope, while block toppling is prominent in stronger amphibolites and quartzite lying in the central part.},

If climatic records are used, a record length of 5–10 years (17–35 observed slides and 2– 4 significant storms) is sufficient to provide the same accuracy. The climate-based model suggests that debris-slide frequency changed from approximately 1.6 to 8.3 slides kmϪ2 yrϪ1 during the late 1930s owing to an increased frequency of high-intensity storms. The model accurately predicts the change in slide-scar density observed on sequential aerial photographs following the climatic shift.},

  abstract = {Extra sets of 2D multi-channel seismic and chronostratigraphic data allowed us to undertake analyses of source to sink processes and triggering mechanisms of the gigantic megaslides previously documented off the NW and SE steep slope settings of the Foz do Amazonas basin. As these megaslides comprise two sets of stacked allochthonous masses within the Upper Miocene-Quaternary sedimentary record, they are now described as Mass-Transport Complexes (MTCs) and have been renamed the Amapa  Megaslide Complex (AMC) and the Para -Maranha\textasciitilde o Megaslide Complex (PMMC). Individual megaslides of both MTCs can mobilize up to kilometre-thick sedimentary series as allochthonous masses with distinct flow directions, degrees of sediment disruption and internal coherence. Megaslides spread downslope over areas as large as thousands of km2, attaining dimensions comparable to the world's largest masstransport deposits. Among all the megaslides, the basal and largest AM1 megaslide (AMC) stands as a quite unique example of mass-transport deposit in the basin, interpreted as a dominant carbonate allochthonous mass sourced from a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform. The instability was probably triggered between the late Miocene and the end of the Early Pliocene by the gravitational collapse of the mixed platform under its own weight, after successive subaerial exposures which generated karstification processes. Siliciclastic-type megaslides, on the other hand, are all sourced from large upslope slide and/or rotated blocks (up to 60 km wide in the case of the PMMC). The detachment of upslope blocks was triggered by structurally-induced seabed movements during the Mid Pliocene-Pleistocene (in the case of the PMMC) and during the Pleistocene (in the case of the AMC). All mapped features support the interpretation of sedimentary blocks which have undergone long lasting deformation, having been variably folded and faulted by the sliding along an overpressured condensed section (H3 horizon). H3 horizon equally acts as the upper d ecollement level for the gravity tectonic system that operates on the regional scale of the Foz do Amazonas basin. In such a context, the results of this study evidence complex links between variable modes and scales of gravity processes (gravity tectonics and MTCs emplacements), all induced by instability created from a condensed section prone to produce pore fluid overpressure. And yet, seismic attributes of the d ecollement H3 across the slope, characterized by a reflector of negative polarity of high amplitude, indicate that the potential for similar large scale sediment failures continues to exist across the AMC and PMMC.},

  abstract = {Optical imagery can reveal spectral properties of forest canopy, which rarely allows for finding accurate correspondence of canopy features with soils and hydrology. In Amazonia non-floodable swampy forests can not be easily distinguished from non-floodable terra-firme forests using just bidimensional spectral data. Accurate topographic data are required for the understanding of land surface processes at finer scales. Topographic detail has now become available with the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) data. This new digital elevation model (DEM) shows the feature-rich relief of lowland rain forests, adding to the ability to map rain forest environments through many quantitative terrain descriptors. In this paper we report on the development of a new quantitative topographic algorithm, called HAND (Height Above the Nearest Drainage), based on SRTM-DEM data. We tested the HAND descriptor for a groundwater, topographic and vegetation dataset from central Amazonia. The application of the HAND descriptor in terrain classification revealed strong correlation between soil water conditions, like classes of water table depth, and topography. This correlation obeys the physical principle of soil draining potential, or relative vertical distance to drainage, which can be detected remotely through the topography of the vegetation canopy found in the SRTM-DEM data.},

Its severe and sometimes long-lasting negative effects contrast with the less-documented positive effects on ecosystems, raising numerous questions about the dual role of landsliding, the feedbacks between biotic and geomorphic processes, and, ultimately, the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms. We present a conceptual model in which feedbacks between biotic and geomorphic processes, landslides, and ecosystem attributes are hypothesized to drive the dynamics of mountain ecosystems at multiple scales. This model is used to integrate and synthesize a rich, but fragmented, body of literature generated in different disciplines, and to highlight the need for profitable collaborations between biologists and geoscientists. Such efforts should help identify attributes that contribute to the resilience of mountain ecosystems, and also should help in conservation, restoration, and hazard assessment. Given the sensitivity of mountains to land-use and global climate change, these endeavors are both relevant and timely.},

  abstract = {Rockfall ages in tectonically active regions provide information regarding frequency and magnitude of earthquakes. In the hyper-arid environment of the Dead Sea fault (DSF), southern Israel, rockfalls are most probably triggered by earthquakes. We dated rockfalls along the western margin of the DSF using terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides (TCN). At each rockfall site, samples were collected from simultaneously exposed conjugate boulders and cliff surfaces. Such conjugate samples initially had identical pre-fall (\{''\}inherited\{''\}) TCN concentrations. After boulder detachment, these surfaces were dosed by different production rates due to differences in post-fall shielding and geometry. However, in our study area, pre-rockfall inheritance and post-rockfall production rates of TCN cannot be evaluated. Therefore, we developed a numerical approach and demonstrated a way to overcome the above-mentioned problems. This approach can be applied in other settings where rockfalls cannot be dated by simple exposure dating. Results suggest rockfall ages between 3.6 +/- 0.8 and 4.7 +/- 0.7 ka. OSL ages of sediment accumulated behind the boulders range between 0.6 +/- 0.1 and 3.4 +/- 1.4 ka and support the TCN results. Our ages agree with dated earthquakes determined in paleoseismic studies along the entire length of the DSF and support the observation of intensive earthquake activity around 4-5 ka.

The most significant recent advances include the expanding application of permafrost thermal models within spatial models, application of transient numerical thermal models within spatial models and incorporation of permafrost directly within global circulation model (GCM) land surface schemes. Future challenges for permafrost modelling will include establishing the appropriate level of integration required for accurate simulation of permafrost-climate interaction within GCMs, the integration of environmental change such as treeline migration into permafrost response to climate change projections, and parameterising the effects of sub-grid scale variability in surface processes and properties on small-scale (large area) spatial models.

  abstract = {Recent research in Umbria, Italy, has shown that landslide susceptibility is controlled by a process called path-dependency, which describes how past landslides control the locations of future landslides. To date, landslide path-dependency has only been characterised in Italy. This raises the question of whether this process occurs in other geomorphic settings, and thus whether path-dependency should be more universally included in landslide susceptibility assessments. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to investigate and quantify landslide path dependency in the Nepal Himalaya. This is achieved by applying several path dependent metrics to three monsoon-triggered landslide inventories for the central-eastern Nepal Himalaya. These inventories were developed at two different spatial and temporal resolutions. As such, we aim not just to quantify landslide path-dependency, but also to assess whether path dependency characteristics are resolution-dependent. We find strong evidence that landslide path dependency is occurring in Nepal, with all three inventories having more overlap between past and new landslides than expected from a random distribution, and a tentative observation that the expected degree of overlap between landslides decreases with time. Finally, whilst path-dependency is observable across both of the investigated inventory resolutions, we find that the rates and magnitudes of the quantified path dependent metrics are sensitive to inventory length, study region size and the size/type of landslides mapped. Overall, our results corroborate the path-dependency observations from Italy, confirming that this process does occur in other geomorphic settings, and thus suggesting that path-dependency should be explicitly and universally considered in landslide susceptibility approaches.},

  abstract = {Quantifying erosion rates, and how they compare to rock uplift rates, is fundamental for understanding landscape response to tectonics and associated sediment fluxes from upland areas. The erosional response to uplift is well-represented by river incision and the associated landslide activity. However, characterising the relationship between these processes remains a major challenge in tectonically active areas, in some cases because landslides can preclude obtaining reliable erosion rates from cosmogenic radionuclide (CRN) concentrations. Here, we quantify the control of tectonics and its coupled geomorphic response on the erosion rates of catchments in southern Italy that are experiencing a transient response to normal faulting. We analyse in-situ 10Be concentrations for detrital sediment samples, collected along the strike of faults with excellent tectonic constraints and landslide inventories. We demonstrate that 10Be-derived erosion rates are controlled by fault throw rates and the extent of transient incision and associated landsliding in the catchments. We show that the low-relief sub-catchments above knickpoints erode at uniform background rates of ∼0.10 mm/yr, while downstream of knickpoints, erosion removes ∼50\% of the rock uplifted by the faults, at rates of 0.10–0.64 mm/yr. Despite widespread landsliding, CRN samples provide relatively consistent and accurate erosion rates, most likely because landslides are frequent, small, and shallow, and represent the integrated record of landsliding over several seismic cycles. Consequently, we combine these validated 10Be erosion rates and data from a geomorphological landslide inventory in a published numerical model, to gain further insight into the long-term landslide rates and sediment mixing, highlighting the potential of CRN data to study landslide dynamics.},

This method – recently termed as Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) – was applied to date five rock glaciers (size range, 0.01–0.12 km2) and one recent rockfall deposit at the study area Schöderkogel-Eisenhut, in the Schladminger Tauern Range (14°03′E, 47°15′N), Austria. The rock glaciers consist of gneiss or high metamorphic series of mica-schist that are comparable in their R-values. Four of them are relict (permafrost absent) and one is intact (containing patches of permafrost). On each of the five rock glaciers, SHD was carried out at 4–6 sites (50 measurements per site) along a longitudinal transect from the frontal ridge to the root zone. Results at all five rock glaciers are generally consistent with each other sharing statistically significant R-values along transects. The range between the highest and the lowest mean R-value at each of the five rock glaciers is 9.9–5.2. Using rock glacier length and surface velocity data from nearby sites, the rock glacier development must have lasted for several thousand years. Furthermore, by using SHD results from rock glaciers of known age from other sites in the region with comparable geology, approximate surface ages of 6.7–11.4 ka were estimated. This indicates long formation periods for all five rock glaciers. Our results suggest that many of the 1300 relict rock glaciers in central and eastern Austria were formed over a long period during the Lateglacial and Holocene period.},

  abstract = {Big landslides are one of the main natural hazards in Kyrgyzstan, which are concentrated in the foothills of the high mountain ranges along the Eastern rim of the Fergana Basin. Because of the high number of landslides and their occurrence over large areas there is a strong need for effective and objective landslide hazard assessment at a regional scale. In Kyrgyzstan satellite remote sensing data represent the only source of multitemporal information about surface conditions covering large areas. Against this background the goal is the development of a satellite remote sensing and GIS-based system for quantitatively oriented and spatially differentiated hazard assessment. During the presented pilot investigations in the area of the Upper Maili Suu river basin a methodological framework has been developed incorporating remote sensing and GIS techniques for various levels of information extraction. So far, methodological investigations have been focused on the potential of satellite remote sensing data from different optical (Landsat-(E)TM, ASTER, MOMS-2P) and radar (ERS-1/2) systems for the creation of an improved knowledge basis for hazard assessment. This includes landslide identification, generation of topographic information and characterization of the geological setting. The derived primary information have been analyzed in a GIS environment to gain an improved process understanding as a main prerequisite for successful hazard assessment. The results show that currently available satellite remote sensing data are suitable for landslide investigation in Kyrgyzstan. Full exploitation of their information potential requires combined analysis with other thematic information based on methods of interactive and automated information extraction.},

  abstract = {The permafrost monitoring network in the polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere was enhanced during the International Polar Year (IPY), and new information on permafrost thermal state was collected for regions where there was little available. This augmented monitoring network is an important legacy of the IPY, as is the updated baseline of current permafrost conditions against which future changes may be measured. Within the Northern Hemisphere polar region, ground temperatures are currently being measured in about 575 boreholes in North America, the Nordic region and Russia. These show that in the discontinuous permafrost zone, permafrost temperatures fall within a narrow range, with the mean annual ground temperature (MAGT) at most sites being higher than À28C. A greater range in MAGT is present within the continuous permafrost zone, from above À18C at some locations to as low as À158C. The latest results indicate that the permafrost warming which started two to three decades ago has generally continued into the IPY period. Warming rates are much smaller for permafrost already at temperatures close to 08C compared with colder permafrost, especially for ice-rich permafrost where latent heat effects dominate the ground thermal regime. Colder permafrost sites are warming more rapidly. This improved knowledge about the permafrost thermal state and its dynamics is important for multidisciplinary polar research, but also for many of the 4 million people living in the Arctic. In particular, this knowledge is required for designing effective adaptation strategies for the local communities under warmer climatic conditions. Copyright \# 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Patterns in fault slip rates through time and space are examined across the transition from the Sierra Nevada to the Eastern California Shear Zone–Walker Lane belt. At each of four sites along the eastern Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone between 38 and 39° N latitude, geomorphic markers, such as glacial moraines and outwash terraces, are displaced by a suite of range-front normal faults. Using geomorphic mapping, surveying, and 10Be surface exposure dating, mean fault slip rates are defined, and by utilizing markers of different ages (generally, \textasciitilde 20ka and \textasciitilde 150ka), rates through time and interactions among multiple faults are examined over 104–105year timescales. At each site for which data are available for the last \textasciitilde 150ky, mean slip rates across the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone have probably not varied by more than a factor of two over time spans equal to half of the total time interval (\textasciitilde 20ky and \textasciitilde 150ky timescales): 0.3±0.1mm year−1 (mode and 95\% CI) at both Buckeye Creek in the Bridgeport basin and Sonora Junction; and 0.4 +0.3/−0.1mm year−1 along the West Fork of the Carson River at Woodfords. Data permit rates that are relatively constant over the time scales examined. In contrast, slip rates are highly variable in space over the last \textasciitilde 20ky. Slip rates decrease by a factor of 3–5 northward over a distance of \textasciitilde 20km between the northern Mono Basin (1.3 +0.6/−0.3mm year−1 at Lundy Canyon site) to the Bridgeport Basin (0.3±0.1mm year−1). The 3-fold decrease in the slip rate on the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone northward from Mono Basin is indicative of a change in the character of faulting north of the Mina Deflection as extension is transferred eastward onto normal faults between the Sierra Nevada and Walker Lane belt. A compilation of regional deformation rates reveals that the spatial pattern of extension rates changes along strike of the Eastern California Shear Zone-Walker Lane belt. South of the Mina Deflection, extension is accommodated within a diffuse zone of normal and oblique faults, with extension rates increasing northward on the Fish Lake Valley fault. Where faults of the Eastern California Shear Zone terminate northward into the Mina Deflection, extension rates increase northward along the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone to \textasciitilde 0.7mm year−1 in northern Mono Basin. This spatial pattern suggests that extension is transferred from more easterly fault systems, e.g., Fish Lake Valley fault, and localized on the Sierra Nevada frontal fault zone as the Eastern California Shear Zone–Walker Lane belt faulting is transferred through the Mina Deflection.},

The model shows differently moving crustal blocks, determining the intervening boundary zones as the main risk regions, where weak earthquakes are also usually concentrated (primarily Diendorf–Čebín Tectonic Zone, Nectava–Konice Fault, Haná Faults, Bělá Fault and Bulhary Fault Shear Zone). The maximum horizontal GNSS differential velocities in the exposed Bohemian Massif reach up to 1.5–2.0 mm·yr−1. The up-thrusted segments of the Western Carpathians move individually \textasciitilde 2 mm·yr−1. The integration of a number of full-area datasets, corresponding to various dimensions and depth levels of crustal processes, allowed us to highlight the important fault zones as driving elements of regional geodynamics.},

  abstract = {Morphometric properties of drainage basins, expressed as indices related to their shapes, altitude variability, river networks and stream profiles, are frequently used as proxy information concerning the relative intensity of uplift. Research procedures lead towards division of an area into classes of relative tectonic activity (various rates of surface uplift) and are typically based on compound indices that jointly consider various individual parameters. Given that index approaches are quantitative in nature and comprise large sets of data, their statistical treatment should become an inherent component of the workflow, whereby the results of the statistical analyses should guide the conclusions. However, various data handling issues seem to be seldom addressed or are given inadequate attention. They include selection of variables, correlation analysis, principles of classification in terms of relative tectonic activity, validity of classifications, and criteria for using specific statistical procedures. In this paper we demonstrate the need for rigorous statistical data analysis in a morphometric study, focused on an intraplate mountainous terrain in Central Europe (Orlickie-Bystrzyckie Mountains Block), subject to low or moderate uplift. We analysed 56 drainage basins within the footwall blocks of several prominent fault-generated escarpments. Following literature guidance, the hypsometric and shape characteristics of the drainage basins were considered, whereas clustering and pure-rank based approaches were tested to distinguish classes of relative tectonic activity. The results were compared with indicators of tectonic activity calculated for the escarpments themselves and using DEM-derived terrain attributes indicating enhanced erosion. In addition, we used statistical tests to identify possible lithological influence on the variability of morphometric parameters, which in this study was found to be of secondary importance. Statistical considerations neither allowed for unequivocal classification of drainage basins in terms of relative tectonic activity, nor did they reveal a clear spatial distribution pattern of drainage basins with different morphometric characteristics, typically considered to reflect tectonic forcing. Thus, statistics-based analysis is recommended to avoid the risk of over-interpretation. It is also possible that the likely morphometric signature of tectonically less active settings comprises spatially inconsistent information rather than it is typified by consistently low values of various morphometric parameters.},

  abstract = {Distinguishing between mountain fronts of various origins is an issue of considerable scientific and practical importance. Whereas morphometry is often applied to fault-generated fronts and a range of indices has been proposed to assess their activity, comparative studies of fault-generated and fault-line escarpments seem very rare. In this paper we analyze two mountain fronts delimiting the Sowie Mountains block (SW Poland, Central Europe) from the opposite sides. One is evidently a fault-generated escarpment, whereas the other one coincides with a distinct lithological boundary, although along an old Variscan fault, and appears to be a fault-line escarpment. These two fronts are characterized in terms of sinuosity, spacing ratio, slope characteristics, altitude variability using geostatistical approach, longitudinal stream profiles, drainage basin characteristics and the presence of mid-slope flats within the elevated block. Clustering and statistical hypothesis testing were used to recognize patterns of spatial similarities and differences. The main findings emerging from this study are as follows. The two mountain fronts are different in terms of morphological characteristics, but only some indices and parameters have discriminating value, mainly SL index, drainage basin typology, altitude variability in the frontal zone. Some parameters, such as drainage basin asymmetry and the altitude position of water divide flats, change non-systematically and their interpretation remains ambiguous. Their variability probably reflects local controls. Overall, the results strongly indicate that geomorphic histories of the mountain fronts and overarching controls of their long-term evolution were different. Morphometric properties and landform features, if considered in isolation and without statistical treatment, appear to be ambiguous in interpretation. This applies particularly to drainage basin properties. However, drainage basin clustering using a k-means algorithm helped to discriminate between the fronts and may be recommended for similar studies elsewhere.},

In this paper their usefulness in geomorphological studies of landslides is explored. Using a sample of twelve objects from the Sudetes, SW Poland, spatial and statistical distributions of TWI and TRI values are presented and discussed. Both TWI and TRI prove capable of differentiating landslide population into smaller groups, consistent with their variable origin and mechanism of displacement. Considerable disruption of original slope surface during movement results in high TWI range values and low TRI values, whereas for translational rockslides and slumps the relationship is opposite. Spatial patterns of high TWI values help to identify lines of preferential drainage of a landslide body. Directional analysis shows that different types of displacement have their specific morphological signatures. Both TWI and TRI provide new information about landslide morphology and are recommended for use, especially to characterize depositional parts of landslides. The study is based on high resolution digital elevation model derived from airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) which proved useful in detailed characterization of landslide morphology.},

  abstract = {As with bedload transport, wood transport in rivers is governed by several factors such as flow regime, geomorphic configuration of the channel and floodplain, or wood size and shape. Because large-wood tends to be transported during floods, safety and logistical constraints make field measurements difficult. As a result, direct observation and measurements of the conditions of wood transport are scarce. This lack of direct observations and the complexity of the processes involved in wood transport may result in an incomplete understanding of wood transport processes. Numerical modelling provides an alternative approach to addressing some of the unknowns in the dynamics of large-wood in rivers. The aim of this study is to improve the understanding of controls governing wood transport in mountain rivers, combining numerical modelling and direct field observations. By defining different scenarios, we illustrate relationships between the rate of wood transport and discharge, wood size, and river morphology. We test these relationships for a wide, multithread reach and a narrower, partially channelized single-thread reach of the Czarny Dunajec River in the Polish Carpathians. Results indicate that a wide range of quantitative information about wood transport can be obtained from a combination of numerical modelling and field observations and from document contrasting patterns of wood transport in single- and multithread river reaches. On the one hand, log diameter seems to have a greater importance for wood transport in the multithread channel because of shallower flow, lower flow velocity, and lower stream power. Hydrodynamic conditions in the single-thread channel allow transport of large-wood pieces, whereas in the multithread reach, logs with diameters similar to water depth are not being moved. On the other hand, log length also exerts strong control on wood transport, more so in the single-thread than in the multithread reach. In any case, wood transport strongly decreases with increasing piece volume, although this relation is not linear. We also document a nonlinear relationship between wood transport and flood magnitude. A threshold discharge was identified below which wood transport is negligible. This threshold is higher in the multithread reach, while in the single-thread reach floods of lower magnitude are able to transport wood downstream. Wood transport ratio increases with discharge until it reaches an upper threshold or tipping point, and then decreases or increases much more slowly. This threshold is clearly related to bankfull discharge, but it is much higher for the multithread reach than for the single-thread one. Although modelling input and field observations were taken from a specific river, our findings and conclusions are likely to be applicable to a much larger suite of (mountain) rivers.},

  abstract = {The climatic condition of Western Ghats has influenced the process of weathering and landslides in this mountainous tract along the southwest coast of India. During the monsoon period, landslides are a common in the Western Ghats, and its intensity depends upon the thickness of the loose unconsolidated soil formed by the process of weathering. Debris landslides with a combination of saprock, saprolite and soil, indicate the role of weathering in landslide occurrences. This paper reports on how the weathering in the windward slope of Western Ghats influences the occurrence of landslides and the factors which accelerate the weathering process. Rock and soil samples were collected from the weathering profile of hornblende gniess and granite gneiss. The chemical analysis and the calculated Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) indicate the significant weathering and its possible influence on landslide occurrences in the study area. Mainly, the CIA value of lateritic soil and forest loam indicated the extent of high chemical weathering in this region. Rainfall is the dominant parameter influencing the chemical weathering process. In addition, deforestation, land use practices and soil erosion are some of the other important factors accelerating the weathering process and landslide occurrences in the region. The locations of the previous landslides superimposed on geology and soil show that most of the landslide occurrences are associated with the highly weathered zone, particularly lateritic soil and the ‘severe’ (rock outcrop) erodability zone.},

We present the results of a field survey, documenting the concentration of the effects of the tsunami along a section of coastline not exceeding 30\,km in length. A hydrodynamic simulation using the earthquake dislocation as the source of the tsunami fails to reproduce both the amplitude of the waves, and especially their concentration between the cities of Kiashahr and Jafrood. Rather, we show that the model of an underwater landslide, presumably triggered by the earthquake, and taking place on the steep slopes of the continental shelf approximately 10\,km offshore, can fit the principal inundation characteristics identified during the survey. We suggest that the occurrence of such underwater landslides should become a primary ingredient to the assessment of tsunami risk along the Southern shores of the Caspian Sea.},

  abstract = {The Serra do Mar escarpment, located along the southeastern coast of Brazil, is a high-elevation passive margin escarpment. This escarpment evolved from the denudation of granites, migmatites and gneisses. The granites outcrop in the form of a ridge along the escarpment crest, due to its differential erosion (‘sugarloaf’ hills) from the surrounding lithologies. Several studies suggest that the passive margin escarpments are actively retreating toward the interior of the continent. However, no prior study has calculated the long-term denudation rates of Serra do Mar to test this hypothesis. In this study, we measured the in situ-produced 10Be concentration in fluvial sediments to quantify the catchment-wide long-term denudation rates of the Serra do Mar escarpment in southern Brazil. We sampled the fluvial sediments from ten watersheds that drain both sides of the escarpment. The average long-term denudation rate of the oceanic side is between 2.1- and 2.6-fold higher than the rate of the continental side: 26.04 ± 1.88 mm ka-1 (integrating over between 15.8 ka-1 and 46.6 ka-1) and 11.10 ± 0.37 mm ka-1 (integrating over between 52.9 ka-1 and 85.4 ka-1), respectively. These rates indicate that the coastal base level is controlling the escarpment retreat toward the continental high lands, which is consistent with observations made at other high-elevation passive margins around the globe. The results also demonstrate the differential erosion along the Serra do Mar escarpment in southern Brazil during the Quaternary, where drainages over granites had lower average denudation rates in comparison with those over migmatites and gneisses. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the ocean-facing catchments have been eroded more intensely than those facing the continent. The results also reveal that drainage over the granites decreases the average denudation rates of the ocean-facing catchments and the ‘sugarloaf’ hills therefore are natural barriers that slowly retreat once they are exhumed.

Glacially polished bedrock outcrops are offset by right-lateral strike-slip faults. Gravitational structures appear to be spatially connected to these active faults. Dating using the in situ-produced 10Be cosmogenic nuclide performed on glacial, tectonic and gravity surfaces. The late glacial–interglacial Holocene transition is constrained by 10Be ages between 12 and 15 ka obtained on glacially polished surfaces. The main tectonic activity closely post-dates the main deglaciation event and is constrained by 10Be ages of 11 and 7–8 ka obtained on fault scarps. Three successive periods of landsliding are recognized, at 11–12, 7–9 and 2.5–5.5 ka. These Holocene ages were obtained on right-lateral strike-slip fault scarps indicating that recent Alpine tectonics are expressed by transcurrent movements. The discussed close age relationship between deglaciation and a tectonic pulse may suggest that post-glacial rebound and enhanced pore water pressure do influence seismogenic tectonic activity. Gravitational destabilizations at 11–12 and 7–9 ka are coincidental with the main tectonic activity, and suggest tectonic shaking as a landslide trigger. The third gravitational destabilization at 2.5–5.5 ka could be attributed either to slope weakness resulting from multiple low-magnitude earthquake events, as currently revealed by the seismic activity or to climatic causes during the wetter optimum climatic period. These early and middle Holocene ages coincide with a phase of large landslide throughout the Alps scale which suggests that these large gravitational mass movements could be related to combined effects of intense tectonic activity and transitions form cold and dry period to warm and wetter phase.},

Shortening across the zone of transpression leads to oblate finite strain ellipsoids (k{$<$}1). By considering the superposition of small increments of strain various model deformation paths are computed. These are used to interpret the development of structures, such as en-??chelon folds, in transpression zones. The incremental strain ellipsoid allows prediction of the orientation of the principal stresses and hence brittle structures within such zones. The model is also applied to bends and terminations of shear zones and used to interpret the observed patterns of folds and fractures in these. ?? 1984.},

The deepest-exposed interval of the fan succession contains cracked lithoclasts probably fractured by overburden from late-glacial ice; this interval is topped by an intra-sequence unconformity. Following final glacial retreat, and rapid aggradation of the alluvial fan and talus slope, the geomorphic regime changed to erosion, as recorded by fanhead trenching and cutting of fluvial terraces, abandonment and vegetating of scree slopes, and excavation of 'talus flatirons'. The changeover from the accumulation of fan and talus to abandonment and dissection probably took place during the terminal late-glacial interval to perhaps the early Holocene. This erosional regime persists until present.},

  abstract = {On 22 February 1756 the largest historically recorded rockslide in Norway took place at Tjelle in the Langfjord (Western Norway). The rockslide created three displacement waves of up to 50m in height that caused 32 casualties and destroyed most houses and boats along the shores of the Langfjord. The trigger and contributing factors leading to the Tjellefonna rockslide are largely unknown and even seismic triggering has previously been suggested. This study provides a thorough back-analysis of the Tjellefonna rockslide using detailed geomorphological, engineering geological and tectonic field mapping in combination with topographic reconstructions, bathymetry analysis, volume estimations and numerical slope stability analysis. The back-scarp and eastern flank of the Tjellefonna scar form several tens of meter high rock walls, while the basal failure surface and other parts of the scar are covered by rock avalanche debris that extend from the back-scarp down to the bottom of the Langfjord. The rockslide occurred in granodioritic gneisses with variably developed metamorphic foliation that is folded and strike parallel to the fjord. Two prominent fault zones are present in close proximity to the Tjellefonna scar; one is steeply SE-dipping (Tjelle fault), while the other one is sub-horizontal to shallow SE-dipping (Ritlehamran fault). Both fault zones are linked to the Møre-Trøndelag Fault Complex, with one of its branches forming the Langfjord lineament and probably also the faults at Tjellefonna. Additionally, there are four persistent joint sets that together with the metamorphic foliation and the Tjelle fault define the back-scarp of the rockslide and give a fracturing of the rock mass corresponding to a Geological Strength Index (GSI) of 45–55. The GSI decreases significantly to 10–20 in the fault zones, which form distinct weakness zones in the rock slope. Volume estimates based on a reconstruction of the ante-rockslide topography range from 9.3 to 10.4millionm3, which is lower than previous volume estimates (12–15millionm3). Large portions of the failed rock mass remained on land and only approximately 3.9millionm3 entered the fjord. The observed discontinuities in the rock mass at Tjellefonna do not allow for a simple kinematic failure mechanism due to the lack of moderately SE-dipping structures. The basal failure surface was most likely not composed of a single structure, but of a complex interplay of fault zones, metamorphic foliation, joints and broken rock bridges. Numerical slope stability modelling highlights that weak fault zones are essential for the development of the failure surface over a long time. This progressive failure was likely aided by low- to medium-magnitude earthquakes that are frequent in the region. Numerical slope stability modelling and historical accounts suggest, however, that heavy, long-lasting rainfall was the triggering factor for the 1756 Tjellefonna rockslide rather than an earthquake.},

  abstract = {Numerous large landslide deposits occur in the Tien Shan, a tectonically active intraplate orogen in Central Asia. Yet their significance in Quaternary landscape evolution and natural hazard assessment remains unresolved due to the lack of "absolute" age constraints. Here we present the first 10Be exposure ages for three prominent (N107 m3) bedrock landslides that blocked major rivers and formed lakes, two of which subsequently breached, in the northern Kyrgyz Tien Shan. Three 10Be ages reveal that one landslide in the Alamyedin River occurred at 11–15 ka, which is consistent with two 14C ages of gastropod shells from reworked loess capping the landslide. One large landslide in Aksu River is among the oldest documented in semi-arid continental interiors, with a 10Be age of 63–67 ka. The Ukok River landslide deposit(s) yielded variable 10Be ages, which may result from multiple landslides, and inheritance of 10Be. Two 10Be ages of 8.2 and 5.9 ka suggest that one major landslide occurred in the early to mid-Holocene, followed by at least one other event between 1.5 and 0.4 ka. Judging from the regional glacial chronology, all three landslides have occurred between major regional glacial advances. Whereas Alamyedin and Ukok can be considered as postglacial in this context, Aksu is of interglacial age. None of the landslide deposits show traces of glacial erosion, hence their locations and 10Be ages mark maximum extents and minimum ages of glacial advances, respectively. Using toe-to-headwall altitude ratios of 0.4–0.5, we reconstruct minimum equilibrium-line altitudes that exceed previous estimates by as much as 400 m along the moister northern fringe of the Tien Shan. Our data show that deposits from large landslides can provide valuable spatio-temporal constraints for glacial advances in landscapes where moraines and glacial deposits have low preservation potential.},

  abstract = {The analysis of the three-dimensional rockfall scar geometry provides clues for the understanding of the failure mechanisms acting on cliffs, of the conditioning factors, and on the frequency of the events. In this paper, a supervised step-by-step methodology is presented for establishing the statistical magnitude–frequency relation of rockfall scar volumes, using a point cloud from Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) data. The methodology includes a procedure for identifying discontinuity surfaces, calculating the areas of those which are exposed, and the height of rockfall scars. In the estimation of the rockfall scar volume a key issue is the consideration of the minimum spacing of the discontinuity sets to differentiate between step-path surfaces and undulated ones. Having obtained the distributions of both the basal area and height of the scar across the slope, the volume of the rockfall scars is calculated stochastically by multiplication of these two parameters by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. Both distributions of the basal area and of the rockfall scar volume are found to be power-law, with the exponent b ranging from 0.9 to 1.2. The relation obtained might be used as a first approach of rockfall magnitude–frequency curves in large cliffs.},

  abstract = {Bedding planes are a known factor that controls the type, abundance and pattern of landslides. Where layered rocks crop out, the geometrical relationships between the attitude of the bedding and the geometry of the terrain is crucial to understand landslide phenomena. Obtaining information on bedding attitude for large areas through field surveys is time-consuming, and resource intensive, hampering the possibility of quantitative investigations on the control of bedding planes on landslides. We propose a GIS-based method to extract information on bedding planes from the analysis of information captured through the visual interpretation of stereoscopic aerial photographs and a digital representation of the terrain. We tested the method in the Collazone study area, Umbria, Central Italy, where we used spatially distributed information on beddings and terrain information obtained from a 10×10-m DEM to determine morpho-structural domains. We exploited the morpho-structural terrain zonation, in combination with landslide information for the same area, to investigate the role of beddings in controlling the distribution and abundance of landslides in the study area. We found that beddings condition the location and abundance of relict and deep-seated landslides, most abundant in cataclinal slopes, and do not condition significantly the shallow landslides. We expect the method to facilitate the production of maps of morpho-structural domains in layered geological environments. This will contribute to a better understanding of landslide phenomena and to foster the preparation of advanced landslide susceptibility and hazard models.},

  abstract = {Kyrgyzstan is one of the most exposed countries in the world to landslide hazard. The large variability of local geological materials, together with the difficulties in forecasting heavy precipitation locally and in quantifying the level of ground shaking, call for harmonized procedures to better quantify the hazard and the negative impact of slope failures. By exploiting new advances in Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, together with concepts from Bayesian statistics, and promoting the use of open-source tools, we aim to identify areas in Kyrgyzstan where the potential for landslide activation exists. A range of conditioning factors and their potential impact on landslide occurrence are quantitatively assessed on the basis of the spatial distribution of landslides by applying weights-of-evidence modelling based on (1) a landslide inventory of past events, (2) terrain-derived variables of slope, aspect and curvature, (3) a geological map, (4) a distance from faults map, and (5) a seismic intensity map. A spatial validation of the proposed method has been performed, indicating sufficient measures of significance to predicted results. Initial results are promising and demonstrate the applicability of the method to all of Kyrgyzstan, allowing the identification of areas that are more susceptible to landslides with a level of accuracy greater than 70~\%. The presented method is, therefore, capable of supporting land planning activities at the regional scale in places where only scarce data are available.},

The study focused on the spatial congruence of new initiation zones and potentially marginal permafrost, which should be especially sensitive to climatic change and is presumed to be currently degrading. The results show that distinct changes in the spatial position of debris flow initiation areas mainly occurred at elevations above this marginal zone. Consequently, the changes detected in debris flow activity do not appear to have been influenced by atmospheric warming‐induced degradation of permafrost. However, a link may exist to the thickening of the active layer caused by the melting of a glacier. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The morphometry of chutes (couloirs), rock funnels, and open cirques are related to the structure of dissected rock masses in the Kananaskis region of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. Data for ten morphometric variables were derived from digital elevation models of 56 open rock basins. The basins were classified structurally according to the relative orientations of bedding planes and the rock slopes. A hypothesis of no differences in morphometry among structural classes is rejected from the results of nonparametric analysis of variance and paired comparisons of rank scores. Basins on dip and overdip slopes have a distinct size, and those on anaclinal slopes have a distinct width and shape. Variation in morphometry from low compactness and area/relief (chutes) to high compactness and low area/relief (funnels) to high compactness and area/relief (open cirques) corresponds to a change in dominant structure from orthoclinal to dip-overdip to underdip to anaclinal. The dip of bedding planes relative to the slope of rockwalls controls the mode of initial displacement of joint blocks and, thereby, the spatial distribution of the retreat of rockwalls. The angle between the rock slope and the strike of dipping strata determines whether beds of differing stability form chutes and buttresses (orthoclinal slopes), or extend across rockwalls (cataclinal and anaclinal slopes) and retreat at similar rates to form funnels and open cirques. The optimal structure for large compact rock basins is anaclinal, and the least favourable is cataclinal dip-overdip slopes. Topoclimate and other geologic structures may account for variance in morphometry not explained by differences among structural classes.},

In the present paper, numerical simulations of a series of laboratory experiments performed at the Laboratory for Rock Mechanics of the EPF Lausanne were undertaken with the RASH3D and DAN3D numerical codes. They aimed at analysing the possibility to use calibrated ranges of parameters (1) in a code different from that they were obtained from and (2) to simulate potential-events made of a material with the same characteristics as back-analysed past-events, but involving a different volume and propagation path. For this purpose, one of the four benchmark laboratory tests was used as past-event to calibrate the dynamic basal friction angle assuming a Coulomb-type behaviour of the sliding mass, and this back-analysed value was then used to simulate the three other experiments, assumed as potential-events. The computational findings show good correspondence with experimental results in terms of characteristics of the final deposits (i.e., runout, length and width). Further\textbackslash more, the obtained best fit values of the dynamic basal friction angle for the two codes turn out to be close to each other and within the range of values measured with pseudo-dynamic tilting tests.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, slope instability in high-mountain regions has often been linked to increase in temperature and the associated permafrost degradation and/or the increase in frequency/intensity of rainstorm events. In this context we analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution and potential controlling mechanisms of small to medium-sized mass movements in a high-elevation catchment of the Italian Alps (Sulden/Solda basin). We found that slope-failure events (mostly in the form of rockfalls) have increased since the 2000s, whereas the occurrence of debris flows has increased only since 2010. The current climate-warming trend registered in the study area apparently increases the elevation of rockfall-detachment areas by approximately 300 m, mostly controlled by the combined effects of frost-cracking and permafrost thawing. In contrast, the occurrence of debris flows does not exhibit such an altitudinal shift, as it is primarily driven by extreme precipitation events exceeding the 75th percentile of the intensity-duration rainfall distribution. Potential debris-flow events in this environment may additionally be influenced by the accumulation of unconsolidated debris over time, which is then released during extreme rainfall events. Overall, there is evidence that the upper Sulden/Solda Basin (above ca. 2500 m asl), and especially the areas in the proximity of glaciers, have experienced a significant decrease in slope stability since the 2000s, and that an increase in rockfalls and debris flows during spring and summer can be inferred. Our study thus confirms that “forward-looking” hazard mapping should be undertaken in these increasingly frequented, high-elevation areas of the Alps, as environmental change has elevated the overall hazard level in these regions.},

We use surface weather from three global climate models based on the moderate warming, A1B Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emissions scenario and the SiBCASA land surface model to estimate the strength and timing of the PCF and associated uncertainty. By 2200, we predict a 29–59\% decrease in permafrost area and a 53–97 cm increase in active layer thickness. By 2200, the PCF strength in terms of cumulative permafrost carbon flux to the atmosphere is 190 ± 64 Gt C. This estimate may be low because it does not account for amplified surface warming due to the PCF itself and excludes some discontinuous permafrost regions where SiBCASA did not simulate permafrost. We predict that the PCF will change the arctic from a carbon sink to a source after the mid-2020s and is strong enough to cancel 42–88\% of the total global land sink. The thaw and decay of permafrost carbon is irreversible and accounting for the PCF will require larger reductions in fossil fuel emissions to reach a target atmospheric CO2 concentration.},

  abstract = {The genesis of landslides has traditionally been ascribed essentially to exogenic, nontectonic causes. Thus, it has generally been assumed that progressive erosion oversteepens slopes until they become unstable and collapse by forming slides; the specific triggers in each case would be exogenic influences such as, for instance, an extreme weather period. This paper shows that in practically all cases of mass-movements, endogenic processes are also of fundamental importance. In the first place, a landscape responds as a complex open system existing in a quasi-stationary state at the edge of chaos in which an endogenic input and exogenic outflow of mass and energy occur; this quasi-stationary state can become unstable resulting in landslides. In the second place, a direct predesign is present because of endogenic causes, viz. by a former or the present geotectonic stress field. Thus, some common notable contentions regarding the origin of landslides are shown to be false. A better understanding of the mechanisms for landslide genesis is illuminated using examples from the Chinese mountain ranges at the east end of the Himalayas. In these particular cases, the orientations of mass movements are directly controlled Ž‘predesigned’. by the present-day local tectonic stress. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The cross-bordering earthquake hazard map for three Central European countries, the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia (CZ-PL-SK) in the sense of the Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP) was elaborated both in terms of macroseismic intensities and in terms of peak ground accelerations (PGA). A new earthquake parametric catalogue for CZ-PL-SK (Schenková et al., 1999) allows the source regions to be delineated with respect to tectonic structures. Regions for Austria and Germany were taken from the D-A-CH area with some modifications in the border zone with the Czech Republic and Poland. Regions of other surrounding countries were defined with respect to national earthquake catalogues and geologico-geophysical data of Central European countries. For each source region earthquake data were normalised to obtain a reliable annual recurrence graph and the maximum expected earthquakes. Attenuation laws were defined to allow more advanced earthquake hazard maps to be calculated by the standard probabilistic McGuire’s (1976) approach. The obtained GSHAP hazard maps for the CZ-PL-SK area were calculated for the return period of 475 years. Besides a comparison with the hazard values for the D-A-CH area (Grünthal et al., 1995, 1996; Grünthal, 1997), the map was also compared with the effective ground acceleration map for Austria (Lenhardt, 1996) and in both cases a very good coincidence was found.},

  abstract = {The origin of linear features in mountain terrain that form distinct vertical steps is generally not obvious and has been discussed to be related to either tectonic faulting or gravitational slope deformation. A strong geomorphological lineament running oblique to the slope and forming a convex step in the topography is located on the mountain Middagstinden just west of the valley Innfjorddalen, western Norway. In previous studies this lineament has been interpreted to be the surface expression of a Holocene reverse fault previously called the Berill Fault, indicating the first evidence for neotectonic faulting in southern Norway. Now, detailed structural field mapping has revealed the existence of a set of normal fault planes striking subparallel to this lineament and to the main extensional faults associated with the Caledonian collapse. Electric resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles of the valley floor and excavated parallel trenches confirm the regional extent of the fault, but the sediments observed in the trenches do not indicate any Holocene activity. Furthermore, the lineament is a limiting structure of a large rock-slope instability. Kinematic feasibility tests based on structural field measurements indicate wedge failure along the intersection of the fault and the local foliation. However, this intersection line is not exposed on the slope surface. Hence, simple wedge or translational sliding along the slope is not feasible, except in its uppermost part. Both the displacements observed by differential global navigation satellite system (dGNSS) surveys and the geomorphological characteristics, for instance, counterscarps, superficial mass movements, coherent slide blocks and slope bulging, indicate complex deformation mechanisms. The deformation evidently changed along the slope in type and degree including planar sliding in the uppermost part, potentially large wedge sliding in the middle part, and incremental internal deformation in a direction out of the slope in the lower part. The complex kinematics and geomorphological characteristics account for the definition of a deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD). Furthermore, the findings reveal that the geomorphological lineament is of gravitational origin and not neotectonic. It has formed by a reactivation of the pre-existing, Caledonian, normal fault system due to the DSGSD, and is hence an example of pseudotectonics ('apparent reverse fault').},

  abstract = {There is a strong possibility that environmental change (whether climate or land use) will be manifest as changes in the size–frequency distribution of landslides. Here, evidence is presented for this from western Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia. Remote sensing and spatial analysis have been applied to map mass movements in the central part of the Maily‐Say Valley and to detect recent landslide activations. The evolution of landslide activity over the past 50 years has been analysed on the basis of pre‐existing landslide maps and new analyses of aerial photographs as well as Quickbird images. Five inventories were produced for the years 1962 (based on the existing map of 1962 and aerial photographs of 1962), 1984 (based on the existing map of 1977 and aerial photographs of 1984), 1996 (based on aerial photographs of 1996), 2002 (based on the existing map of 2003 and Quickbird imagery of 2002) and 2007 (based on Quickbird imagery of 2007). The geomorphologic features contained in the catalogues represent the landslide bodies observed from remote imagery of the corresponding year. Mapped landslides are generally considered as the result of a series of slope failure events. Size–frequency analyses applied to the five landslide inventories show that both the number and size of unstable slopes increased from 1962 (162 objects) to 2007 (208 objects) and the power‐law exponent decreased over time. This changing power‐law exponent may indicate that landslide‐related hazards are increasing. This tendency is documented in more detail for two active landslide zones, one in the main valley and one located to the west of it. Landslide detection methods were used to assist the evolution of slope instabilities. Choosing appropriate thresholds, the image subtraction method based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) allowed accurate detection of new sliding activation in these two zones. This confirmed the results of the more extensive survey that there is a systematic shift in power law exponents and size–frequency distributions for Central Asian landslides.

Back-calculated strength values, however, were indistinguishable from those obtained through field and conventional laboratory measurements on the weakest members of each rock formation, as well as on glacial sediments along the Cascade front. These results contrast with the conventional assumption that relief is incision-limited and indicate that the relief of mountain ranges can reflect landscape-scale material strength, as well as the interaction of tectonic and climatic processes.},

The sediments of the lake are used for detecting and dating past debris flow events during the last 4000 years and their driving factors. Comparing palynological and sedimentological data the results suggest, that mainly heavy precipitation in winter and summer as well as snow melt events in spring enhance the release of debris flow events. Therefore especially longer periods with humid and cool climate conditions show a clearly higher debris flow activity. The pollen diagram documents human impact on the catchment area since the late Neolithic, but the anthropogenic activities influenced the event activity only indirectly. Grazing and deforestation reduced the retention of debris by vegetation and results in thicker debris flow layers in the lake sediments.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, the use of geophysical techniques has become popular in many geomorphological studies. However, the correct handling of geophysical instruments and the subsequent processing of the data they yield are difficult tasks. Furthermore, the description and interpretation of geomorphological settings to which they apply can significantly influence the data gathering and subsequent modelling procedure (e.g. achieving a maximum depth of 30~m requires a certain profile length and geophone spacing or a particular frequency of antenna). For more than three decades geophysical techniques have been successfully applied, for example, in permafrost studies. However, in many cases complex or more heterogeneous subsurface structures could not be adequately interpreted due to limited computer facilities and time consuming calculations. As a result of recent technical improvements, geophysical techniques have been applied to a wider spectrum of geomorphological and geological settings. This paper aims to present some examples of geomorphological studies that demonstrate the powerful integration of geophysical techniques and highlight some of the limitations of these techniques. A focus has been given to the three most frequently used techniques in geomorphology to date, namely ground-penetrating radar, seismic refraction and DC resistivity. Promising applications are reported for a broad range of landforms and environments, such as talus slopes, block fields, landslides, complex valley fill deposits, karst and loess covered landforms. A qualitative assessment highlights suitable landforms and environments. The techniques can help to answer yet unsolved questions in geomorphological research regarding for example sediment thickness and internal structures. However, based on case studies it can be shown that the use of a single geophysical technique or a single interpretation tool is not recommended for many geomorphological surface and subsurface conditions as this may lead to significant errors in interpretation. Because of changing physical properties of the subsurface material (e.g. sediment, water content) in many cases only a combination of two or sometimes even three geophysical methods gives sufficient insight to avoid serious misinterpretation. A “good practice guide” has been framed that provides recommendations to enable the successful application of three important geophysical methods in geomorphology and to help users avoid making serious mistakes.},

  abstract = {The terms `gravity gliding' and `gravity spreading' have long been used to describe deformation driven by gravity alone. However, the traditional de®nitions of these terms cannot be applied unambiguously in many situations. The primary dif®culties arise because rocks are not ideally rigid, detachment surfaces may not be planar, substrates may be deformable, and rock bodies do not deform in isolation. The term `gravity spreading' is still useful if it is simply de®ned as gravity-driven lateral extension and vertical contraction, regardless of basal slope and coherence of the body. I suggest that the term `gravity gliding' should be used rarely, and only if the de®ning characteristics are clearly stated and understood. In most cases, more detailed descriptions should be used instead of, or in addition to, either of these terms to capture the behavior of rock masses deforming under gravity. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this article we present an overview of the global permafrost C pool and of the processes that might transfer this C into the atmosphere, as well as the associated ecosystem changes that occur with thawing. We show that accounting for C stored deep in the permafrost more than doubles previous high-latitude inventory estimates, with this new estimate equivalent to twice the atmospheric C pool. The thawing of permafrost with warming occurs both gradually and catastrophically, exposing organic C to microbial decomposition. Other aspects of ecosystem dynamics can be altered by climate change along with thawing permafrost, such as growing season length, plant growth rates and species composition, and ecosystem energy exchange. However, these processes do not appear to be able to compensate for C release from thawing permafrost, making it likely that the net effect of widespread permafrost thawing will be a positive feedback to a warming climate.},

  abstract = {The 60 × 106 m3 Séchilienne landslide (Belledonne Massif, Western Alps) is located on the right bank of the EastWest trending Romanche valley which is shaped by glacial and alluvial processes during the Quaternary. Its head scarp (N 35 m high) was dated by Le Roux et al. (2009) using the cosmic ray exposure (CRE) method. Even though these previous results revealed that the initiation of the instability occurred several thousand years after ice down-wastage in the valley, the internal landslide evolution is not constrained. In this paper, we provide 63 additional 10Be samples collected from the internal scarps and the main scarp, as well as on glacially polished rock surfaces. The aim is to constrain the global landslide kinematics (internal and head scarps) and its relationship with glacier retreat. Results from glacially polished surfaces point out that complex shielding processes (relict moraines, soil deposits and seasonal snow cover) might have affected rock dating. Despite scattering of the resulting ages, the dataset shows that the glacial retreat was achieved between 17.5 and 13 ka. Exposure ages obtained on gravitational scarps reveal that the landslide initiation occurred 8 to 6 ka ago. From the initiation until 2 ka the gravitational kinematics was slow (\textasciitilde 2 mm·year−1) and focused around the head scarp, leading to a general slope subsidence. After 2 ka, the exposure rates increased significantly (\textasciitilde 8 mm·year−1) with the development of pervasive internal deformation of the landslide mass. This new scenario for the Séchilienne slope reflects a progressive rock-slope weakening since 8 ka, associated with a continuous activity of a deep-seated surface failure.},

The cross-folds are buckle structures that deform the attenuated gneissic layering, plunge parallel to the regional elongation lineation, range from upright to recumbent, and exhibit distinctive hinge-parallel elongation lineations, all features of pure-shear-dominated ductile transtension. Our L-S fabric data are consistent with kinematic modelling that predicts progressive constrictional strain in the hinge zones of transtensional folds, and with dynamic modelling that predicts rotation of flattened fold limbs into moderately dipping attitudes. On the basis of petrologic data, we show that cross-folding post-dated the peak Ottawan metamorphism and took place during retrogression and exhumation of the thrust-sheet stack.},

  abstract = {In identifying controls on rock slope form a distinction is made between: (1)rock slopes with joints which dip steeply out of a cliff and hence are subject to mass failure of the rock mass above a critical joint; and (2) rock slopes with inclinations which are either in equilibrium with the mass strength of their rocks, or have profiles which will develop towards strength equilibrium as cross joints open. In the first class of slope, stability results not just from the basic frictional resistance of the rock but also from the frictional roughness along the critical joint and from the normal stress acting across that joint. Stability may be reduced by weathering and loss of strength of the joint wall rock. As a result of normal stress variations with depth, induced by overburdens, high cliffs which are not undercut have a concave profile. The second group of slopes includes those with inclinations controlled at the scale of individual joint blocks, buttressed slopes and those on unjointed rock masses. Buttressed and unjointed rock masses develop towards a condition of mass strength equilibrium as cross joints open. Strength equilibrium slopes may be recognized by application of a rock mass strength classification proposed for geomorphic purposes. Eleven propositions are formulated which identify controls on rock slope development and some consequences of these controls.},

The geomechanics classification system of naturally fractured rock masses is modified to decrease personal judgement involved in its calculation. Instead of six parameters in the classical rock mass rating (RMR) system, only five basic parameters are considered in the proposed system, which are namely, rock quality designation (RQD) value with the underlying frequency distribution function of intact lengths; uniaxial or point load strength of intact rock material; conditions of the most unfavorable joints; groundwater condition; and joint orientation. Classical lumprating system is replaced by continuous grading system which leaves no ambiguity for an inexperienced engineer in allocating grades based on quantitative field or laboratory measurements. Finally, necessary charts are presented for obtaining straightforward design values concerning average stand-up time and corresponding unsupported span of excavations in fractured rock mass; cohesion as well as friction angle of the rock mass. The continuous RMR system is very convenient for calculators or in writing computer software. The proposed methodology reduces the scale of subjectivity and leads to a unique rock mass design value.},

  abstract = {The 1994 Northridge earthquake (Mw = 6.7) triggered extensive rock slope failures in Pacoima Canyon, immediately north of Los Angeles, California. Pacoima Canyon is a narrow and steep canyon incised in gneissic and granitic rocks. Peak accelerations of nearly 1.6 g were recorded at a ridge that forms the left abutment of Pacoima Dam; peak accelerations at the bottom of the canyon were less than 0.5 g, suggesting the occurrence of topographic amplification. Topographic effects have been previously suggested to explain similarly high ground motions at the site during the 1971 (Mw = 6.7) San Fernando earthquake. Furthermore, high landslide concentrations observed in the area have been attributed to unusually strong ground motions rather than higher susceptibility to sliding compared with nearby zones. We conducted field investigations and slope stability back-analyses to confirm the impact of topographic amplification on the triggering of landslides during the 1994 earthquake. Our results suggest that the observed extensive rock sliding and falling would have not been possible under unamplified seismic conditions, which would have generated a significantly lower number of areas affected by landslides. In contrast, modelling slope stability using amplified ground shaking predicts slope failure distributions matching what occurred in 1994. This observation confirms a significant role for topographic amplification on the triggering of landslides at the site, and emphasises the need to select carefully the inputs for seismic slope stability analyses.},

Vertical electric sounding, debris surface analysis and a topographic survey were performed on this rock glacier between 1991 and 2000. High precision measurement records were obtained using a total station. Horizontal and vertical movements of the rock glacier were measured by means of sixteen steel rods. Horizontal and vertical angles and distances to each rod were measured from three stations on a bedrock ridge. Total and annual average displacements were derived from the emergence value and the horizontal displacement of each rod. Then the horizontal and vertical displacement rates in different sectors of the rock glacier were compared. The inferred surface deformation was characterized by both extensional and compressive flows as well as thinning of the frozen body. The displacement rates showed temporal variations related to atmospheric thermal changes, pointing to a high sensibility of the rock glacier. D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Most recent developments of Schmidt-hammer exposure-age dating (SHD) as a calibrated-age dating tool have been limited by the use of locations at two age control points. This has necessitated: (1) making assumptions about a linear R-value–age relationship; and (2) basing predictions of age errors only on R-value variance at the two age control points. This paper analyses 9900 R-values obtained from multiple-age control points on a sequence of glacioisostatically raised shorelines with well constrained ages (Skuleskogen High Coast World Heritage Site and environs, Gulf of Bothnia, northern Sweden) ranging from modern to 10.5 ka in age. The sampling design involved 30 measurements on granite beach boulders from 30 sites at 11 age control points. The R-value–age relationship is best described by a linear function (ordinary least squares, OLS) with an R2 of 0.89 (p {$<$} 0.0001). Predicted-age errors are calculated using two approaches: (1) OLS regression, which takes account of the uncertainties associated with the regression line and the age control points; and (2) weighted total least squares (WTLS) regression which, in addition, takes account of possible shoreline age errors and the heteroscedasticity of R-value residuals with increasing age. With both approaches, 95\% predicted-age errors are relatively modest: ±355–455 years and ±300–515 years, respectively, with larger R-value variance and hence uncertainty for older surfaces, and the possibility of further improvement from a more selective field sampling scheme that differentiates between age-related and non-age-related rock-surface variability. Our results also indicate that for certain lithologies and weathering environments, it is possible to construct reliable calibrated-age curves from relatively few age control points.},

  abstract = {The Schmidt hammer is a relatively cheap, portable, sturdy instrument with proven value over the last two decades or so in rapidly dating coarse inorganic deposits of diverse origins. Early views were that its dating role was limited to distinguishing recently exposed from much older. Typically, either a few sites of possibly different ages or occasional older surfaces amongst many young sites were studied. More recently, calibration curves based on individual R-value means from small numbers (2–4) of sites of known ages have been used to estimate the ages of undated sites. We present Schmidt hammer rebound (R–) values from 28 ‘Little Ice Age’ (and younger), 23 Preboreal and 7 Younger Dryas glaciated surfaces in southern Norway in order, first, to test rigorously the robustness of the instrument as a relative-age dating tool. Despite being obtained from different surfaces (moraines, glaciofluvial deposits and bedrock) and varied metamorphic lithologies, the R-value overall means and 95\% confidence intervals for the ‘Little Ice Age’, Preboreal and Younger Dryas age categories (respectively, 60.071.6, 41.671.4 and 34.272.0) are statistically significantly different. Only two outlying sites in the two younger age categories have overlapping confidence intervals, demonstrating remarkable robustness in differentiating early- and late-Holocene surfaces. The distinction between Preboreal and Younger Dryas sites (with terminal dates o2000 years apart) is less clear but still statistically significant, though possibly partly because of enhanced weathering conditions at the predominantly well vegetated Younger Dryas sites. Second, we examine the feasibility and desirability of controlling non-age-related factors, including some previously considered critical (instrument wear, operator bias, initial rock surface texture), which emerge either as less important than previously argued or as relatively unimportant, together with others previously unreported (e.g. long-term changes in lichen, soil, snow and vegetation covers). Third, we investigate the potential for calibrated-age dating by applying exploratory, linear rates of R-value decline to selected combinations of sites. The results suggest that error limits of ca 7700 to 71600 years should be achievable over the Holocene timescale. This improved dating capability, however, will require adequate numbers of site means not only for each age category used to define these curves but also for each set of test surfaces of the same ages. Recommendations are made for a suitable sampling protocol for developing further the Schmidt hammer as a calibrated-age dating tool.},

  abstract = {Precipitation-induced erosion and orographic precipitation are thought to be coupled during mountain building, potentially serving as a negative feedback on mountain uplift. However, the strength and spatial uniformity of this coupling are not well understood due to limitations in correlating past climate and orogenic events through proxy records, as well as the substantial differences in temporal and spatial scales at which climatic and erosional processes are typically modeled. Here, we present a novel numerical modeling framework that overcomes these order-of-magnitude differences in scale to study the co-evolution of climate, erosion, and mountain building. Our modeling framework uses asynchronous coupling and nested domains to link the National Center for Atmospheric Research Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model with Landlab, a landscape evolution model, through a hydrological model (WRF-Hydro). We conduct numerical experiments that simulate coupled climate-erosion processes during uniform surface uplift of a north-south trending mountain belt from an initial flat landscape over 5 Myrs between the latitudes 0° and 40°S in South America. Our results show that the precipitation-erosion coupling differs in strength as a function of both surface elevation and climate regime. With an increase in surface elevation and gradient, precipitation in the tropical and mid-latitude regions increases and a rain shadow forms on the leeward side of the mountain crest, while precipitation in sub-equatorial and subtropical regions exhibits little change. Erosion responds to these regional differences in precipitation and creates distinctive mean elevation, slope, and hypsometry. Our study highlights that interactions between climate and erosion have a first-order impact on mountain building over geological timescales and that it is necessary to incorporate these interactions in modeling land surface evolution.},

  abstract = {A rock glacier-like boulder deposit on the Table Cliffs Plateau, Utah, has moved slowly over a long period of time and has affected over 220 trees growing on it. Analyses of annual rings of trees affected by this and other slope movements show events such as inclination, shear, corrasion, burial, exposure, inundation, and nudation. Datable responses to these events are reaction-wood growth, growth suppression and release, ring termination and new callous growth, sprouting, succession, and miscellaneous structural and morphological changes. Various events may produce delayed, antagonistic, interfering, or irrelevant event responses, necessitating procedural caution. A modified skeleton plot of yearly event responses was constructed for each sample in this study with only strongly replicating dates from within trees considered valid. The resulting event-response curve shows peak periods of movement centered around the years 1781, 1803, 1827, 1849, 1869, 1885, 1890, 1907, 1910, 1923, 1938, 1942, 1944, and 1958. Spectral analysis of the event-response curve, mean annual precipitation, and an independently derived tree-ring precipitation surrogate suggests a possible relation between precipitation and slope movement. Analyses of temperature data did not produce results in spite of the presence of internal ice which might be expected to contribute to movement. Map plots of movement through time show event responses scattered in linear zones throughout the slope during main episodes of movement in any given year, with little evidence of long-term surges. Different parts of the slope move at different times and some parts move more than others.},

  abstract = {Dendrogeomorphic dating of past landslide events is a valuable tool for the assessment of landslide activity, providing unique data for the analysis of triggers or the modelling of landslide behaviour in the future. Unfortunately, tree-ring-based methods as well as dating approaches suffer from some limitations. One of the less frequently addressed limits of dendrogeomorphic analysis concerns the changing capacity of trees to record landslide events in their tree-ring series with increasing age. This study uses, to date, the most extensive database of tree-ring series (1736) of 868 disturbed individuals of Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. subjected to 20 landslides in the Outer Wester Carpathians for the assessment of their age-dependent sensitivity. The distribution of the total number of 1485 growth disturbances (reaction wood - RW and abrupt growth suppression - GS) throughout all decades of tree life shows evidence of distinct changes in the capacity for trees to record landslide signals with increasing age. The occurrence of RW dominated in the juvenile decades of tree life and then increased again in the 9th decade. The frequency of GS gradually increased and culminated during the 7th and 8th decades. The two intensities of growth disturbance (strong and moderate) expressed temporally balanced ratios, suggesting an effect of disturbance intensity rather than changing tree age. The important factors controlling age-dependent tree sensitivity to landslide movements based on the results seem to be changing stem elasticity, decreasing annual increment rates, root system development and increasing tree body weight. Moreover, this study demonstrates that landslide type (e.g., rigid block vs. plastic flow-like landslides) and bedrock geology distinctly modify agedependent sensitivity that should be taken into account during the sampling of trees for landslide dating.},

  abstract = {Landslides predisposed by the anisotropy of flysch bedrock are typical features of mass movements affecting the Outer Western Carpathians. A dendrogeomorphic investigation involving an extensive dendrometric (n=1680) survey and tree-ring analysis of 176 Norway spruce trees (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) was used to reconstruct the spatial and temporal activity of the Mazák landslide, situated in the highest part of the Czech Outer Western Carpathians. As revealed by geomorphic analysis and electrical resistivity tomography, the landslide is a translational medium-depth (b30 m) bedrock feature originating at the intersection of inclined bedding planes with diagonal (NW–NNW striking) and longitudinal (NE striking) sets of joints and faults. Dendrometric data supported by correlogram analysis suggest the coincidence of landslide reactivations with the presence of diagonal pervasive bedrock fractures. A tree-ring analysis shows nine major landslide years (1929, 1940, 1949, 1960, 1972, 1980, 1985, 1997, and 2000) accompanied by six additional years with minor reactivations (1933, 1945, 1955, 1958, 1977, and 1996) during the past hundred years (1912–2011). Major growth reactions to landslide movements in the study site were demonstrated by the occurrence of reaction (compression) wood and by the abrupt suppression of growth. An analysis of climatological data shows that the most likely meteorological triggers of the landslide reactivations are summer precipitation (especially heavy rainfall events in July and August with total rainfall of {$>$}200–300 mm per 10 days).},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequently used theoretical scheme based on the event–response relationship. Seventy-four individuals of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) exhibiting visible external disturbance, were sampled on the Girová landslide (the largest historical flow-like landslide in the Czech Republic). This landslide reactivated in May 2010, and post-landslide tree growth responses were studied in detail. These growth responses were compared with the intensity and occurrence of visible external tree disturbance: tilted stems, damaged root systems, and decapitation. Twenty-nine trees (39.2\%) died within one to four years following the 2010 landslide movement. The trees that died following the landslide movement were significantly younger and displayed significantly greater stem tilting than the live trees. Abrupt growth suppression was a more-frequent response among the dead trees, whereas growth release dominated among the live trees. Only two trees (2.7\%) created no reaction wood in response to the landslide movement. Forty-four percent of the trees started to produce reaction wood structure after a delay, which generally spanned one year. Some eccentric growth was evident in the tree rings of the landslide year and was significant in the first years following the landslide movement. Missing rings were observed only on the upper sides of the stems, and no false tree rings were observed. The results confirm the general validity of event-response relationship, nevertheless this study points out the limitations and uncertainties of this generally accepted working scheme.},

  abstract = {Landslides are a type of mass wasting and denote any downslope movement of soil and rock under the influence of gravity; as such they can represent a dangerous natural hazard process, especially in case that they affect inhabited areas or transport infrastructure. Because the occurrence of landslides is typically favoured by terrain and lithological conditions, the process is frequently concentrated in relatively small, isolated regions exhibiting suitable initial conditions of terrain instability. Extensive regional assessments of landslide activity have been used in the past to uncover common triggers and process patterns, mostly in the aftermath of large, regional disasters. By contrast, however, regional reconstructions of past landslide activity have not been realized with dendrogeomorphic techniques, and with the aim to date past landslide histories over extended time periods and with annual dating precision. This study therefore aims at disentangling landslide dynamics at the regional scale (covering ca. 600 km2) by using growth-ring records of trees that grow on active landslides. The studied area of the Hostýnsko-vsetínská hornatina Mts. (Central Europe) is well known for its high landslide activity, but has so far been lacking a detailed chronology of past events. To this end, we dated past activity on 26 landslide bodies using tree-ring series from 1322 disturbed trees to reconstruct 327 landslide reactivations during the last century.},

We performed tree-ring analysis of a large number (n = 274) of broad-leaved trees to reconstruct the spatio-temporal patterns of landslide reactivation for a period spanning more than one hundred years (1884–2011). Although tree rings of broad-leaved trees are less-reliable archives of landslide activity than those of conifers, the application of a methodology based on the weighting of disturbance signals within eccentricity series generated a usable dataset of sliding activity affecting anisotropic flysch bedrock. Although some known landslide years could not be found (or were expressed by only weak signals) in the reconstructed dataset, the majority of landslide events reconstructed from the tree-ring series coincide with hydrometeorological data, revealing a correlation with heavy summer rainfalls lasting from two to ten days. The spatial distribution of landslide recurrence derived from the tree-ring records together with electrical resistivity tomography and a kinematic analysis of slope failures suggest a close link between the concentration of landslide activity and the presence of faulted or fractured flysch bedrock.},

  abstract = {The Crimean Mountains in Ukraine constitute a seismically active region that is abundant in various types of mass movement. The limestone escarpments that rise above the Black Sea coast in the vicinity of the town of Yalta are particularly subject to considerable rockfall, landslide and debris flow processes that often endanger infrastructure and human life. One of these very active slopes is the area of the ancient Taraktash rockslide, characterised by active block-type movements (lateral spreading, toppling, and incipient sliding), rockfalls, ongoing sliding activities and debris flows. The aims of this study were (i) to employ tree-ring analysis to reconstruct a record of slope instabilities (mainly block-type movements, rockfalls, landslides and debris flows) within the Taraktash slope deformation over a period of more than two centuries and (ii) to establish the degree of correlation between periods of enhanced slope activity and both historical earthquakes and climatic data. The temporal frequency of significant slope processes was addressed through a tree-ring analysis that took 738 increment cores from 255 Crimean pine trees Pinus nigra ssp. pallasiana. The tree-ring record reveals periods of increased activity of block-type movements, rockfalls and landslides during the major earthquakes in 1790, 1875, 1927 and 1986. Although the slope processes studied are predominantly driven by seismic activity, their intensity and duration are also dependent on climatic factors. This is especially true for landslides and debris flows, which occurred mainly in years characterised by high precipitation totals.},

Additionally, an extension of the approach takes into account the full statistics of the analysis error of the variational analysis to study the inherent uncertainties of the proxy data representing the imperfect paleo climate information and their impact on the field reconstruction. The method is applied to reconstruct realizations of monthly mean temperature anomaly fields in Europe for January and July in Europe as averages for several time slices in the Late Glacial and Holocene. Single realizations can differ substantially from the field of expectation values in terms of spatial patterns due to the inherent correlation of the spatial uncertainties of the paleo proxy data. Additionally, the fields of expectation values generally are much smoother than the realizations. This indicates that it is misleading to only consider expectation values. Further, the ensembles of realization are used to calculate robust error measures for area mean values, which is valuable for the quantitative comparison of the results of different time slices.},

  abstract = {Interaction between faulting and landscape evolution in regions of active tectonics allows us to use subtle geomorphological markers for estimating fault slip rates. Geomorphic features of two valleys connected with the bottom of the Alcalà de Xivert graben, at the Maestrat graben system (eastern Spain), suggest that they correspond to the lowest segments of ancient valleys whose original heads were located at the axis of the neighbouring Irta range. They were beheaded owing to displacement of the Torreblanca and Irta faults during a period of active extensional faulting in Middle Pleistocene times. These faults produced a negative inversion of the relief, sinking a narrow graben (the Ametler graben) at the middle of the Irta range whose alluvial infill buried the midsegments of the beheaded valleys. This hypothesis has been tested by applying two geomorphic indices, the Stream-gradient index (SL) and the Valley width/height ratio (Vf), as well as by considering surface and subsoil information about the sedimentary infill of the Ametler graben. From this evolutionary model, after reconstructing hypothetical longitudinal profiles of the ancient rivers, and taking into account a new absolute age obtained for the alluvial infill of the Ametler graben, slip rates at the northern segment of the Torreblanca fault have been approached. The throw rate has been constrained between a minimum of 0.04–0.07 mm/year for the last 1.9 to 2.6 Ma, and a maximum of 0.26–0.30 mm/year for the last 253.3 ± 18.0 ky. These values are comparable to those averaged on other active faults in the central-eastern Iberian Chain for the overall Late Pliocene–Pleistocene times. Nevertheless, the Torreblanca fault shows exceptionally high activity within the context of the Maestrat and Catalonian grabens, which can explain its deep imprint in landscape evolution.},

  abstract = {Assessment of erosion status of a watershed is an essential prerequisite of integrated watershed management. This not only assists in chalking out suitable soil and water conservation measures to arrest erosion and conserve water but also helps in devising best management practices to enhance biomass production in watersheds. The geologic stages of development and erosion proneness of the watersheds are quantified by hypsometric integral. The estimation of hypsometric integral is carried out from the graphical plot of the measured contour elevation and encompassed area and by using empirical formulae. In this study, efforts were made to estimate the hypsometric integral values of the Sainj and Tirthan watersheds and their sub watersheds in the Lesser Himalayas using four different techniques, and to compare the procedural techniques of its estimation and relevance on erosion status. It was revealed that the hypsometric integral calculated by elevation–relief ratio method was accurate, less cumbersome and easy to calculate within GIS environment. Also comparison of these hypsometric integral values revealed that the Sainj watershed (0.51) was more prone to erosion than the Tirthan watershed (0.41). Further, the validation of these results with the recorded sediment yield data of 24 years (1981–2004) corroborated that the average annual sediment yield during this period for Sainj watershed (0.53 Mt) was more than that of the Tirthan watershed (0.3 Mt). Thus, the hypsometric integral value can be used as an estimator of erosion status of watersheds leading to watershed prioritization for taking up soil and water conservation measures in watershed systems.},

We investigated the main factors and processes involved in soil genesis at Cape Lamb on Vega Island. Thirty pedons were sampled, described and analyzed for morphological, physical, geochemical and mineralogical properties. Twenty-two pedons were classified as Gelisols/Cryosols. Three soil groups were identified: (1) mixed substrates soils (2), acid sulfate soils and (3) basaltic soils. Acid sulfate soils showed the greatest degree of weathering with pronounced acidity due to sulfurization. Basaltic soils were the least developed and presented shallow pedons of skeletic character and high alkalinity. Parent material was the main factor in the differentiation of the studied soils. Climate and landforms were also important. Desert pavement, salinization and ahumic features induced by the semiarid climate, oppose acidification and cryoturbation, characterizing the transitional location of Vega Island. Patterned ground dominates on periglacial highlands, while desert pavements are more common on paraglacial surfaces. Despite the semiarid climate, pedogenesis is active in the studied soils, with clay minerals, sulfate minerals and pedogenic Fe-oxides formation.},

  abstract = {Theoretical calculations indicate that elastic stresses induced by surface topography may be large enough in some landscapes to fracture rocks, which in turn could influence slope stability, erosion rates, and bedrock hydrologic properties. These calculations typically have involved idealized topographic profiles, with few direct comparisons of predicted topographic stresses and observed fractures at specific field sites. We use a numerical model to calculate the stresses induced by measured topographic profiles and compare the calculated stress field with fractures observed in shallow boreholes. The model uses a boundary element method to calculate the stress distribution beneath an arbitrary topographic profile in the presence of ambient tectonic stress. When applied to a topographic profile across the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory in central Pennsylvania, the model predicts where shear fractures would occur based on a Mohr–Coulomb criterion, with considerable differences in profiles of stresses with depth beneath ridgetops and valley floors. We calculate the minimum cohesion required to prevent shear failure, Cmin, as a proxy for the potential for fracturing or reactivation of existing fractures. We compare depth profiles of Cmin with structural analyses of image logs from four boreholes located on the valley floor, and find that fracture abundance declines sharply with depth in the uppermost 15 m of the bedrock, consistent with the modeled profile of Cmin. In contrast, Cmin increases with depth at comparable depths below ridgetops, suggesting that ridgetop fracture abundance patterns may differ if topographic stresses are indeed important. Thus, the present results are consistent with the hypothesis that topography can influence subsurface rock fracture patterns and provide a basis for further observational tests.

By the removal of the rock mass (due to erosion, excavation, etc.) a redistribution of stresses and subsequent deformations take place near the surface. On the slope, the rock is disrupted into blocks d\textasciitilde e to release joints, the joints widen and the blocks undergo creep movement. Depending on time or a suitable impulse (such as anthropogenous intervention), the creep movement of the blocks passes into a faster motion - sliding or falling.

In this paper we describe a variety of techniques that can visualize a DEM. We then compare five techniques to ascertain which performs the most complete and unbiased visualization. We assess the visualization techniques by comparing landforms mapped from them against a detailed morphological map (derived from mapping of multi-azimuth relief-shaded DEMs cross-checked with stereo aerial photographs). Results show that no single visualization method provides complete and unbiased mapping. The relief-shaded visualizations are particularly prone to azimuth biasing, although they can highlight subtle landforms. We recommend curvature visualization for initial mapping as this provides a non-illuminated (and therefore unbiased) image. Initial mapping can then be supplemented with data from relief-shaded visualizations. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Field observations from a permafrost thermal monitoring network in the Norman Wells pipeline corridor Northwest Territories, and thermal modelling have been utilized to gain insights into the relative effects that both environmental disturbance associated with vegetation clearance and ongoing climate warming have on the ground thermal regime in the vicinity of a right-of-way (ROW). This analysis was conducted to generate information that may aid engineering design of northern development projects, the assessment of environmental impacts associated with these projects and the development of related environmental monitoring and management plans. The separate and combined effects of environmental disturbance and climate change on the ground thermal regime beneath and adjacent to a ROW in an area of discontinuous permafrost are investigated using a two-dimensional finite element thermal model. A simplified soil profile consisting of one metre of peat overlying a fine-grained mineral soil is considered. A limited set of scenarios consider the effect of: ROW clearing alone; ROW clearing followed by vegetation recovery; ROW clearing combined with climate warming of 0.5 °C per decade; and ROW clearing followed by vegetation recovery combined with climate warming. Simulation results for warm thin permafrost (mean annual ground temperature above − 1 °C; 20 m thick) indicate that the combined effects of ROW disturbance and climate warming are likely to result in permafrost degradation within 20 to 40 years, and ROW-disturbance effects may extend off-ROW under scenarios of climate warming. In colder and thicker permafrost (mean annual ground temperature below − 1 °C; 50 m thick), the combined effect of climate warming and ROW disturbance will not likely lead to talik formation within 50 years, although seasonal thaw penetration will increase. For the range in ground thermal conditions considered, the results of the simulations indicate that the effects of ROW disturbance outweigh those associated with climate warming in the initial 10 to 15 years following disturbance, although climate warming becomes important over longer time periods. Climate warming and its influence on the ground thermal regime should therefore be incorporated into the design of northern development projects (and assessment of associated environmental impacts) expected to operate over two decades or more and where ground instability associated with permafrost thawing is a concern.},

Due to the unprecedented level of detail of these datasets, geomorphologists are facing new challenges, giving more in-depth answers to a broad(er) range of fundamental questions across the full spectrum of the Earth's (and Planetary) processes. This contribution builds on the existing literature of geomorphometry (the science of quantitative land-surface analysis) and feature extraction (translate land surface parameters into extents of geomorphological elements). It provides evidence of critical themes as well as emerging fields of future research in the digital realm, supporting the likely effectiveness of geomorphometry and feature extractions as they are advancing the theoretical, empirical and applied dimension of geomorphology. The review further discusses the role of geomorphometric legacies, and scientific reproducibility, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action towards improving the transparency, and efficiency of scientific research, and accelerate discoveries in geomorphology. In the current landscape, substantial changes in landforms, ecosystems, land use, hydrological routing, and direct anthropogenic modifications impact systems across the full spectrum of geomorphological processes. Although uncertainties in the precise nature and likelihood of changes exist, geomorphometry and feature extraction can aid exploring process regimes and landscape responses. Taken together, they can revolutionise geomorphology by opening the doors to improved investigations crossing space and time scales, blurring the boundaries between traditional approaches and computer modelling, and facilitating cross-disciplinary research. Ultimately, the exploitation of the available wealth of digital information can help to translate our understanding of geomorphic processes, which is often based on observations of past or current conditions, into the rapidly changing future.},

  abstract = {The development of high resolution LiDAR digital terrain models (DTMs) has enabled the exploration of the statistical signature of morphology on curvature distributions. This work analyzes Minimum Curvature distributions to identify the statistical signature of two types of LiDAR-DTM errors (outliers and striping artifacts) in the derived estimates, rather than morphology itself. The analysis shows the importance of modeling these errors correctly, in relation to the scale of analysis and DTM resolution, in order to have reliable curvature estimates. Nine DTMs of different morphological areas are considered, and grouped into a training dataset (without errors) and a test dataset (with errors). In the training dataset, the original DTMs are considered as true values; errors are then applied to these data. Minimum Curvature is computed at multiple scales from each DTM: changes in curvature distributions due only to morphology and scale are characterized from the original data; error effects are then identified from the datasets with simulated errors, and validated against the test dataset. The analysis shows that outliers and striping artifacts can be realistically simulated by heavily left tailed distributions. For DTMs without errors, the scale-dependent change in curvature distribution is primarily controlled by real morphology. When DTMs include errors, curvature distributions become controlled by these errors, whose propagation depends on error distribution, error spatial correlation, and the scale of analysis. This study shows that the curvature distributions are impacted upon differently by striping artifacts and outliers, and that these are clearly distinguishable from the signal of morphological features: a scale-dependent change in curvature distribution can therefore be interpreted as the signature of these specific errors, rather than morphology.

After an introduction on the state of the art, with particular reference to the Alpine region, the results of recent investigations in the two study sites are illustrated. At Cortina d’Ampezzo, several landslides were dated mainly by the radiocarbon method. The most ancient landslide event there involved large rock slides, which affected the dolomitic slopes following the withdrawal of glaciers after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and also slides and flows mainly occurring in pelitic materials of the valley floors (from 13,000 to 10,000 cal BP). A later series of flows occurred between 5500 and 2500 cal BP. In the Upper Badia Valley (Alta Badia), the most ancient events go back to 10,000 and 9000 cal BP, and correspond with earth flows that followed vast rotational slides affecting the bedrock up to a depth of about 50 m. More recent earth flows, involving more modest amounts of material, took place between 6500 and 2300 cal BP.},

In comparison with older work, the number of mesoregions has increased from 316 to 344. In many cases, somefar-reaching changes in meso- and macroregions were made. Nevertheless, in most cases the previous system of units was maintained, with more detailed adjustment of boundaries based on the latest geological andgeomorphological data and the use of GIS tools for the DEM analysis. The division presented here is a creatively developing new work aligning the proposals of the majority of Polish researchers. At the same time, it is a regionalisation maintaining the idea of the work developed by J. Kondracki as well as his theoretical assumptions and the criteria used to distinguish units, which makes it a logical continuation of his regional division.},

New data from 14 watersheds in the states of Santa Catarina (n=7) and Rio de Janeiro (n=7) show that erosion rates vary there from 13 to 90m/My (mean=32m/My; median=23m/My) and that the difference between erosion rates of basins we sampled in the two states is not significant. Sampled basin area ranges between 3 and 14,987km2, mean basin elevation between 235 and 1606m, and mean basin slope between 11 and 29°. Basins sampled in Rio de Janeiro, including three that drain the Serra do Mar escarpment, have an average basin slope of 19°, whereas the average slope for the Santa Catarina basins is 14°. Mean basin slope (R2=0.73) and annual precipitation (R2=0.57) are most strongly correlated with erosion in the basins we studied. At three sites where we sampled river sand and cobbles, the 10Be concentration in river sand was greater than in the cobbles, suggesting that these grain sizes are sourced from different parts of the landscape. Compiling all cosmogenic 10Be-derived erosion rates previously published for southern and southeastern Brazil watersheds to date (n=76) with our 14 sampled basins, we find that regional erosion rates (though low) are higher than those of watersheds also located on other passive margins including Namibia and the southeastern North America. Brazilian basins erode at a pace similar to escarpments in southeastern North America. Erosion rates in southern and southeastern Brazil are directly and positively related to mean basin slope (R2=0.33) and weakly but significantly to mean annual precipitation (R2=0.05). These relationships are weaker when considering all southern and southeastern Brazil samples than they are in our smaller, localized data set. We find that smaller, steeper headwater catchments (many on escarpments) erode faster than the larger, higher-order but lower slope catchments. Erosion in southern and southeastern Brazil appears to be controlled largely by mean basin slope with lesser influence by climate and lithology.},

  abstract = {Glacial and paraglacial processes have a major influence on rock slope stability in alpine environments. Slope deglaciation causes debuttressing, stress and hydro-mechanical perturbations that promote progressive slope failure and the development of slow rock slope deformation possibly evolving until catastrophic failure. Paraglacial rock slope failures can develop soon after or thousands of years after deglaciation, and can creep slowly accelerating until catastrophic failure or nucleate sudden rockslides. The roles of topography, rock properties and deglaciation processes in promoting the different styles of paraglacial rock slope failure are still elusive. Nevertheless, their comprehensive understanding is crucial to manage future geohazards in modern paraglacial settings affected by ongoing climate change. We simulate the different modes and timing of paraglacial slope failures in an integrated numerical modelling approach that couples realistic deglaciation histories derived by modelling of ice dynamics to 2D time-dependent simulations of progressive failure processes. We performed a parametric study to assess the effects of initial ice thickness, deglaciation rate, rock-slope strength and valley shape on the mechanisms and timing of slope response to deglaciation. Our results allow constraining the range of conditions in which rapid failures or delayed slow deformations occur, which we compare to natural Alpine case studies. The melting of thicker glaciers is linked to shallower rockslides daylighting at higher elevation, with a shorter response time. More pronounced glacial morphologies influences slope lifecycle and favour the development of shallower, suspended rockslides. Weaker slopes and faster deglaciations produce to faster slope responses. In a risk-reduction perspective, we expect rockslide differentiation in valleys showing a strong glacial imprint, buried below thick ice sheets during glaciation.},

  abstract = {To reveal the slope-channel interaction in the highest parts of the Western Beskids, we studied the valley floor, colluvial accumulations and slope deformations in the Satina River valley (Outer Western Carpathians, Czech Republic). GNSS geomorphological mapping, geophysical sounding and detailed lithological analyses (grain-size, fabric, clast orientation and particle shape) of the valley infill enabled the presumable reconstruction of the processes that formed the valley. In the uppermost part of the valley the gradual change from the U-shaped to the V-shaped valley is distinctive. The river channel is vertically cut in the middle part of the valley (ca 19 m into the sediments and further 3 m into the bedrock formed by thinly laminated claystones). Colluvial layers formed by multigenerational debris flows with fluvial intercalations form the sedimentary infill in this stretch. The method of electrical resistivity tomography has confirmed deep-seated disintegration of the Lukšinec ridge and the occurrence of several generations of rockslides and rather shallow debris slides on the slopes above the studied site. Accumulations of the landslides are considered to be the source area of a large volume of colluvial sediments in the Satina river catchment. The alternations of layers of different genesis indicate high dynamics of the landscape development in the area. Particular debris flow events were separated by periods of prevailing fluvial processes. A part of the landslide area had been saturated and its consequent reactivation led to the formation of the new debris slide with shallow planar slip plane after the 1997 extreme rainfall event. The canyon-like valley incised into the sandstone flysch rocks is preserved in the lower parts of the catchment. The studied part of the catchment is thus characterized by the geomorphological processes pattern change observed in the formation of a large accumulation in transport limited conditions of a colder period of the Pleistocene (forest-free area) and intensive vertical cutting in supply limited conditions of the Holocene.},

Coring, geophysical sounding and lithological analysis of floodplain deposits supported by AMS (accelerator mass spectrometry) dating enabled the establishment of the primary evolutionary stages of Late Holocene floodplain evolution. During the Late Atlantic and Early Subboreal periods, gravel aggradation and braided environments occurred in the studied floodplain. The Late Subboreal and Early Subatlantic are characterised by overbank sedimentation, and the Middle Subatlantic is marked by the recurrence of gravel aggradation. A major incision phase took place during the Mediaeval Warm Period. The onset of overbank sedimentation in the 15th century correlated with ongoing deforestation of the lower parts of catchment, and colonisation of the mountain ridges during the 16th–17th centuries further accelerated this process. During the 20th century, reforestation of mountains and river-channel training resulted in a significant incision phase. Our data suggest that climate fluctuations were major driving factors for the morpho-sedimentary evolution of the floodplain approximately up to the 12th century, whereas in the latter evolution period, anthropogenic activity superseded natural factors. This transition occurred more than one millennium later than in other Central and Western European catchments.},

Our results show that different weathering rates affect the form of the SH R-value versus Age curve, however a fundamental dependency between the two remains constant over timescales ranging from 102 to 105 years. Power law scaling constants suggest changes in clast weathering rates are primarily affected by climatic (precipitation and temperature) and sedimentologic variables (source terrane petrology).

The displacements of the surface are 3-6 m. The excavation of marl was stopped in 1988, when a total of 5.3 x 106 m3 of material was excavated. Since then the magnitude of surface displacement per year has decreased. The Kostanjek slide is still active. It is estimated that natural stabilization will take a long time, probably decades.

  pages = {4},
  abstract = {Landslides triggered in large numbers by heavy rainfall, earthquake strong ground motion or snowpack ablation have number-area distributions with remarkably similar negative power-law tails. There may be a simple physical explanation for this behaviour. Each landslide begins with slip at a weak point; as the slip surface propagates, fluctuations occur in the forces driving and resisting the propagation. At some point the sum of these fluctuations reaches zero, friction takes the upper hand, and the slip surface stops spreading. The probability that a slip surface triggered at a random point will grow to reach a particular size is a solution of the stochastic differential equation that describes the series of fluctuations as a mixed Gaussian diffusion process. This solution is robustly consistent with landslide size distributions observed in nature. Its steep power-law tail is the result of fluctuations in the net driving force that scale with the spreading slip area, while the average size landslide is determined by fluctuations at the growing perimeter. The origin of the fluctuations is perhaps the variability of topographic relief with scale.},

Due to structural deformation steep dips on the limbs of folds may be encountered in association with thrust faults, jointing and residual shear strength conditions. Such an environment necessitates a rigorous assessment of footwall stability in order to ensure safe and economic exploitation of the coal. This paper provides a detailed review of the factors influencing footwall slope instability in surface coal mining and the major instability mechanisms which have been recognized within the published literature. The analysis of footwalls in the design stage and the back analysis of footwall slope failures has in general been undertaken using predominantly two-dimensional limit equilibrium techniques often incorporating a simplistic elastic column analysis. The application of numerical modelling techniques to surface coal mine footwalls has received little attention. In this paper the authors attempt to illustrate the potential for investigating footwall failure mechanisms and stability using principally the distinct element method. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in the characterization of complex rock slope deformation and failure using numerical techniques have demonstrated significant potential for furthering our understanding of both the mechanisms/processes involved and the associated risk. This paper illustrates how rock slope analyses may be undertaken using three levels of sophistication. Level I analyses include the conventional application of kinematic and limit equilibrium techniques with modifications to include probabilistic techniques, coupling of groundwater simulations and simplistic treatment of intact fracture and plastic yield. Such analyses are primarily suited to simple translational failures involving release on smooth basal, rear and lateral surfaces where the principle active damage mechanisms are progressive failure and/or asperity breakdown. Level II analyses involve the use of continuum and discontinuum numerical methods. In addition to simple translation, Level II techniques can be applied to complex translational rock slope deformations where step-path failure necessitates degradation and failure of intact rock bridges along basal, rear and lateral release surfaces. Active damage processes in this case comprise not only strength degradation along the release surface (e.g., asperity breakdown) but also a significant component of brittle intact rock fracture. Level III analyses involve the use of hybrid continuum–discontinuum codes with fracture simulation capabilities. These codes are applicable to a wide spectrum of rock slope failure modes, but are particularly well suited to complex translation/rotational instabilities where failure requires internal yielding, brittle fracturing and shearing (in addition to strength degradation along release surfaces). Through a series of rock slope analyses the application of varied numerical methods are discussed. Particular emphasis is given to state-of-the-art developments and potential use of Level III hybrid techniques.},

Firstly, a glacial system of a glacial cirque typical of the Bohemian Forest was postulated. Then, morphometric characteristics were counted and compared for components of the system (cirque floor, headwall, deflation plateau, etc.). It is probable that the total altitude (mainly the position of deflation plateaus) was an important factor for the development of glaciers. The following hypothesis was postulated based on connections between morphometric characteristics and genesis of the cirques: (1) the lengthening of the cirques occurred primarily during the cold stages of the Pleistocene depending on the size and position of the deflation plateau, (2) development of the cirques continued after the disappearance of the glaciers by other (particularly periglacial) processes, and (3) fluvial and gravitational processes reshaped the cirques during the warmer stages of the Pleistocene. Two types of ELA (equilibrium line altitude) were calculated: the TP-ELA was probably ca. 1290 m a.s.l and the TPW-ELA in ca. 1021 m a.s.l.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a pair of intensively studied deep seated gravitational slope deformations from the Czech Republic. Structural geological mapping and the interrogation of high resolution LiDAR DEMs have been used to reassess the extent of each slope deformation and to obtain new information about their surface morphologies. Electrical resistivity tomography has been used to image the subsurface structures while rod dilatometers and permanently installed mechanical extensometers have been used to define their kinematic behaviour. Dilatometric measurements from across a fissure the edge of the Mužský Hill DSGSD show that the progressive trend has been interspersed by five periods of movement acceleration since monitoring began in 1990 while extensometric measurements from across a second fissure about 50 m from the edge of the plateau show that this discontinuity was affected by an significant period of extension from 2004 to 2006 and a significant period of compression from 2006 to 2008. These data demonstrate that the Mužský Hill DSGSD is characterised by the lateral spreading of rigid sandstone blocks across a plastic marl formation at the edge of Příhrazy Plateau. Extensometric measurements from the Kněhyně Mountain DSGSD show that a fault located at a depth of about 25 m below the surface is characterised by progressive dilation whereas a fault located at a depth of about 57.5 m below the surface is characterised by episodic vertical dip-slip displacements. Both faults are affected by horizontal dextral strike slip displacements. These data demonstrate that the Kněhyně Mountain DSGSD is characterised by translational rocksliding associated with the neotectonic uplift of the Outer Western Carpathians. The presented kinematic data have been compared to records of precipitation, groundwater level, earthquakes, and strain changes measured by the fault displacement monitoring network EU-TecNet. Strain changes induced by the widespread redistribution of stress through the crustal appear to represent an important and hitherto underappreciated geomorphological process affecting the development of the slope deformations at Mužský Hill and Kněhyně Mountain. Future research will focus discovering whether this finding holds true for other deep seated gravitational slope deformations in different geomorphological and geological settings.},

  abstract = {Relatively little research has been undertaken on the use of digital elevation models to recognize the spatially variable glacial imprint of a landscape. Using theoretical topographies and a landscape evolution model, we investigate to what extent the hypsometric analysis of digital elevation models may be used to recognize the glacial signature of mountain ranges. A new morphometric parameter, which we term the hypsokyrtome (from the Greek: ipsos = elevation, kyrtoma = curvature), is derived from the gradient of the hypsometric curve. The efficacy of the hypsometric integral and hypsokyrtome is tested through the study of the Ben Ohau Range, New Zealand, whose glacial imprint has been described previously. With a numerical model we further test the geomorphic parameters in describing the morphologies of regions subject to diverse climatic and tectonic conditions. The hypsokyrtome is highly sensitive to glacial erosion, and the maps produced provide insights into the spatial distribution of glacial erosion. We use SRTM data and focus on two alternative geomorphic settings: the European Alps and the Apennines. The former has been affected by both fluvial and glacial erosion while the latter mainly exhibits a fluvially dominated morphology. The correlation between elevations with increased glacial erosion and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) equilibrium line altitudes (ELAs) suggests the prevalence of a “glacial buzz saw” in the Alps, indicating that climate may put a limit on alpine topography.},

  abstract = {Debris-flow activity in a watershed is usually defined in terms of magnitude and frequency. While magnitude–frequency (M–F) relations have long formed the basis for risk assessment and engineering design in hydrology and fluvial hydraulics, only fragmentary and insufficiently specified data for debris flows exists. This paper reconstructs M–F relationships of 62 debris flows for an aggradational cone of a small ({$<$} 5 km2), high elevation watershed in the Swiss Alps since A.D. 1863. The frequency of debris flows is obtained from tree-ring records. The magnitude of individual events is given as S, M, L, XL, and derived from volumetric data of deposits, grain size distributions of boulders, and a series of surrogates (snout elevations, tree survival, lateral spread of surges). Class S and M debris flows ({$<$}5 × 103 m3) encompass a typical size of events and have mean recurrence intervals of 5.4 (SD: 3.2) and 7.4 years (SD: 6.7), respectively. Class XL events (104–5 ×104 m3) are, in contrast, only identified three times over the past 150 years, and major erosional activity on the cone was restricted to two of these events in 1948 and 1993. A comparison of results with hydrometeorological records shows that class L and XL events are typically triggered by advective storms (rainfall {$>$} 50 mm) in August and September, when the active layer of the rock glacier in the source area of debris flows is largest. Over the past ∼ 150 years, climate has exerted control on material released from the source area and prevented triggering of class XL events before 1922. With the projected climatic change, permafrost degradation and the potential increase in storm intensity are likely to produce “class XXL” events in the future with volumes surpassing 5 × 104 m3 at the level of the debris-flow cone.},

Thereafter, a summary is presented on the different methods commonly used for the analysis and interpretation of reactions in affected trees. We illustrate selected results from dendrogeomorphological investigations of geomorphic processes with an emphasis on fluvial (e.g., flooding, debris flows) and mass-movement processes (e.g., landslides, snow avalanche), where lots of data have been generated over the past few decades.

  abstract = {Relatively little attention has been given to the stability of methane hydrates, formed during periods of past climate change, currently in areas of continuous permafrost. Although a large portion of the Canadian arctic is underlain by crystalline rocks, the occurrence, phase, and origin of alkanes in crystalline rocks under thick permafrost conditions (N 500 m) have not been reported. For the first time, composition and isotopic data for gases from a crystalline shield environment currently under permafrost conditions are presented. Gas and water samples were collected from exploration boreholes and seeps between 890 and 1130 m depths in the Lupin gold mine, Nunavut, Canada. Gases were methane-dominate (64–87\%), with nitrogen (10–37\%) the next largest component, and smaller amounts of ethane, propane, and carbon dioxide. Pressure and temperature measurements indicated gas hydrates were stable at the site prior to mining operations, a conclusion supported by noble gas and salinity determinations. Gas hydrate stability over the last 120 kyr glacial cycle was demonstrated by calculating transient subsurface pressure and temperature conditions utilizing the Memorial University/University of Toronto Glacial Systems Model (MUN/UofT GSM) and the Hydrogeosphere groundwater flow model. Model results also indicated glacial loading increased subsurface pressures, resulting in increased hydrate stability fields during glacial periods. Subglacial groundwater recharge would be limited by any significant formation of gas hydrates. Gas composition, combined with carbon and hydrogen isotopic determinations on methane (− 56 to − 42‰ VPDB and − 349 to − 181‰ VSMOW), carbon dioxide (− 55 to − 15‰ VPDB), ethane (− 37 to − 27‰ VPDB and − 330 to − 228‰ VSMOW), and propane (− 34 to − 27‰ VPDB and − 196 to − 172‰ VSMOW), indicated formation of natural gases by thermogenic processes, mixed with bacteriogenic gas, reasonable, given site geologic history. Methane hydrate formation affected gas composition and gas δ2H values, complicating the interpretation. Gas production is not a modern process at this location, and the overall contribution to the global carbon budget is small. Glacial groundwater recharge models need to account for methane hydrate formation and dissipation due to changes in subsurface stability fields during glaciation and the effect of methane hydrate on hydraulic conductivity.},

Six Holocene (mainly landgrounded) glacial advances were delimited by these morphological and stratigraphic studies, dated at 6 700–6 400, 4 900–4 400, and shortly after 3 900 14C yr B.P.,with three more recent advances,dated by regional correlations, that occurred between the Holocene regional climatic optimum (3 900–3 000 14C yr B.P.) and the Little Ice Age (ca. 300 14C yr B.P.). In some cases, ice-cored rock glacier formation followed the younger glacier advances. In recent decades, the significant climatic warming recorded in the NE region of James Ross Island has produced a number of changes in the periglacial and glacial landforms. Stone-banked terraces and lobes have developed in the Rink Crags, and protalus rampart formation has ceased in favor of protalus lobe development in the Cerro Triple area. Conical depressions filled with water have also increased in area over the surface of the Lachman II ice-cored rock glacier,threatening to destroy this landform.},

  abstract = {Genetic peculiarities of the rock glaciers in the James Ross Island, Antarctic Peninsula. Rock glaciers are considered amongst the most conspicuous landforms of James Ross Island. Their formation follows the convergence of a series of morphostructural and morphogenetic environmental conditions. The most important morphostructural condition is the presence of basaltic mesas that provide the raw material for the debris cover of the rock glaciers. The morphogenetic conditions involve small polithermal glaciers that due to little summer temperature variations, subtle reduction in the precipitations, and/or changes in the intensity and direction of the main regional winds, become debris covered. An important factor related to the debris cover, particularly to the nearly homogenous debris distribution over the whole glacier surface, is related to the so called oscillation of the regelation front. Under stable climatic conditions, after the debris cover reaches a thickness similar to that of the active layer, the ice core ablation diminishes markedly, remaining only the own plastic deformation of the ice core. The debris cover of the rock glaciers studied in James Ross Island reaches around 0.3 m in thickness close to the valley head, increasing the thickness to more than 1 m in the fronts. The ice cores rarely exceed 80 m in thickness, and close to the central part of the rock glacier the horizontal flow velocity amounts about 0.15 m per year. The formation of these rock glaciers, and some ice cored moraines, goes back to the climatic change that finished the Little Ice Age. The severe climatic warming verified in the last 15 years in the northern sector of Antarctic Peninsula accelerated the collapse of some of these landforms.},

  abstract = {The presence of well-developed tors, boulder fields, and weathering mantles in the Parkajoki area of northeastern Sweden, near the centre of Fennoscandian glaciation, has been used to suggest that these landscapes were preserved during all glacial cycles since ice-sheet initiation in the late Cainozoic. This implies that all successive large-scale glaciations must have had frozen bed conditions across this area to allow for subglacial landscape preservation. Cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al data from three tors and a meltwater channel in the Parkajoki area were used to test this hypothesis of landscape preservation through multiple glacial cycles. Apparent exposure ages of tor summit bedrock surfaces ranging between 79 and 37 ka in an area deglaciated at ∼ 11 ka are consistent with the interpretation of these features as relict landforms that have survived glaciation with little or no erosion. Single nuclide minimum exposure age data require that the tors have survived at least two complete glacial cycles. This estimate is based on (i) the approximate duration of periods of ice sheet cover versus ice free conditions as deduced from the DSDP 607 marine benthic foraminifer oxygen isotope record, in conjunction with (ii) a record of Fennoscandian ice sheet flow traces (and hence, ice sheet extent), and (iii) noting that cosmogenic nuclides are accumulated only during ice free periods. In addition, mean cosmogenic 26Al/10Be concentration ratios from two of the sites indicate a minimum model total history of 605 ka and a maximum erosion rate of 1.6 m Ma-1. Thus, the numerical ages confirm the overall qualitative interpretation of landscape preservation through multiple glacial cycles. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Although reports exist on large rockslides and rock avalanches in the territory of the former Soviet Union, they are not readily available, and few translations have been made. To begin closing this gap, we describe here preliminary data from field reconnaissance, remote sensing and geomorphometry of nine extremely large rock-slope failures in the Tien Shan Mountains of central Kyrgyzstan. Each of these catastrophic and prehistoric failures exceeds an estimated 1 km3 in volume, and two of them involve about 10 km3. Failure of rock slopes in wide valleys favoured the emplacement of hummocky long-runout deposits, often spreading out over {$>$}10 km2, blocking major rivers. Most of these gigantic slope failures are located on or near active faults. Their spatial clustering and the high seismic activity in the Tien Shan support the hypothesis that strong seismic shaking caused or triggered most of these large-scale rock-slope failures. Nevertheless detailed field studies and laboratory analyses will be necessary to exclude hydroclimatic trigger mechanisms (precipitation, fluvial undercutting, permafrost degradation), and to determine their absolute ages, frequency and the large-landslide hazard of central Kyrgyzstan.},

Most of the debris fell to the east of the sharp ridge and was deposited in the relatively shallow sloping Afternoon Creek without causing damage to the highway. Lesser amounts of debris fell to the west of the ridge, sliding 600 m down the steeper Falls Creek and impacting the road.

  abstract = {Abstract: Hazard assessments involving large rock slopes are often problematic, given the influence of geology on failure kinematics and the subsequent influence of the failure kinematics on the rockslide runout. The 2003 Afternoon Creek rockslide in northwest Washington is one such example, where 750 000 m3 of rock slid from a steep ridge harmlessly into Afternoon Creek. However, topographic and structural controls at the source area unexpectedly redirected a small volume ({$<$}10\%) down the opposite side of the ridge along a much steeper travel path, impacting the highway below. Postfailure investigations indicate that the slope still presents a danger. To address this, a framework was developed that links back analyses with forward modelling of failure initiation and runout. Field mapping and data collection were specifically tailored for these analyses. Advanced numerical modelling was used to assess likely rockslide source areas, volumes, and controlling features. These were then used to guide a series of three-dimensional runout simulations to model rockslide travel path, reach, and velocities. The results show that a rockslide originating from the ridge could occur again and that the topography would again direct a small percentage of material down the backside which would reach the highway below.},

  abstract = {The development of surface fissures is an important indicator for understanding and forecasting slope movements. Landslide investigations therefore frequently include the elaboration and interpretation of maps representing their spatial distribution, typically comprising intensive field work and instrumentation. It is only recently that aerial photography with sub-decimetre spatial resolution is becoming more commonly available and opens a window to analyse such features from a remote sensing perspective. While these data are in principle helpful to elaborate maps from image interpretation techniques, there is still no image processing technique available to extract efficiently these geomorphological features. This work proposes a largely automated technique for the mapping of landslide surface fissures from very-high resolution aerial images. The processing chain includes the use of filtering algorithms and post-processing of the filtered images using object-oriented analysis. The accuracy of the resulting maps is assessed by comparisons with several expert maps in terms of affected area, fissure density and fissure orientation. Under homogenous illumination conditions, true positive rates up to 65\% and false positive rates generally below 10\% are achieved. The resulting fissure maps provide sufficient detail to infer mechanical processes at the slope scale and to prioritize areas for more detailed ground investigations or monitoring.},

  abstract = {Landslide inventory mapping is an indispensable prerequisite for reliable hazard and risk analysis, and with the increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery the creation and updating of such inventories on regular bases and directly after major events is becoming possible. The diversity of landslide processes and spectral similarities of affected areas with other landscape elements pose major challenges for automated image processing, and time-consuming manual image interpretation and field surveys are still the most commonly applied mapping techniques. Taking advantage of recent advances in object-oriented image analysis (OOA) and machine learning algorithms, a supervised workflow is proposed in this study to reduce manual labor and objectify the choice of significant object features and classification thresholds. A sequence of image segmentation, feature selection, object classification and error balancing was developed and tested on a variety of sample datasets (Quickbird, IKONOS, Geoeye-1, aerial photographs) of four sites in the northern hemisphere recently affected by landslides (Haiti, Italy, China, France). Besides object metrics, such as band ratios and slope, newly introduced topographically-guided texture measures were found to enhance significantly the classification, and also feature selection revealed positive influence on the overall performance. With an iterative procedure to examine the class-imbalance within the training sample it was furthermore possible to compensate spurious effects of class-imbalance and class-overlap on the balance of the error rates. Employing approximately 20\% of the data for training, the proposed workflow resulted in accuracies between 73\% and 87\% for the affected areas, and approximately balanced commission and omission errors.},

These techniques allow quantification of the rockslide debris volume and reconstruction of the pre-slide topography. It has been estimated that the volume of rock involved in the most recent large rockslide is 8 Mm3. Terrestrial digital photogrammetry is used in the characterization of the failure surface morphology, which is subdivided into four types of step-path geometry comprising both pre-existing discontinuities and intact rock fractures. Incorporation of these data into various rock slope stability numerical modeling methods highlights a complex failure mechanism, which includes sliding along a large scale curved failure surface, intact rock bridge fracturing and lateral confinement. A preliminary quantification of the contribution of intact rock bridges to the shear strength of the failure surface is presented in terms of the apparent cohesion, apparent tensile strength and cumulative length of the intact rock segments.},

  abstract = {The Polochic and Motagua faults define the active plate boundary between the North American and Caribbean plates in central Guatemala. A splay of the Polochic Fault traverses the rapidly growing city of San Miguel Uspantán that is periodically affected by destructive earthquakes. This fault splay was located using a 2D electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) survey that also characterized the fault damage zone and evaluated the thickness and nature of recent deposits upon which most of the city is built. ERT images show the fault as a \textasciitilde 50 m wide, near-vertical low-resistivity anomaly, bounded within a few meters by high resistivity anomalies. Forward modeling reproduces the key aspects of the observed electrical resistivity data with remarkable fidelity thus defining the overall location, geometry, and internal structure of the fault zone as well as the affected lithologies. Our results indicate that the city is constructed on a \textasciitilde 20 m thick surficial layer consisting of poorly consolidated, highly porous, water-logged pumice. This soft layer is likely to amplify seismic waves and to liquefy upon moderate to strong ground shaking. The electrical conductivity as well as the major element chemistry of the groundwater provides evidence to suggest that the local aquifer might, at least in part, be fed by water rising along the fault. Therefore, the potential threat posed by this fault splay may not be limited to its seismic activity per se, but could be compounded its potential propensity to enhance seismic site effects by injecting water into the soft surficial sediments. The results of this study provide the basis for a rigorous analysis of seismic hazard and sustainable development of San Miguel Uspantán and illustrate the potential of ERT surveying for paleoseismic studies.},

We applied airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) to record distribution of paleolandslides possibly associated with the known Suasselkä postglacial fault in Kittilä, western Finnish Lapland. Landslide-buried organic material was radiocarbon dated to bring insight if the landslides were generated by single high-magnitude (Mw {$>$} 7) earthquake or if seismic activity has continued through the Holocene. We found a total of four sets of previously unrecognized paleolandslides to indicate fault-activity in the Kittilä area. The size of the landslide scarps exceeded up to 250–300 m in width, up to 600 m in length and 10 m in the height of the back-wall. A previously unrecognized (tentatively PGF) scarp, 6 m in height and in conjunction with paleolandslides, was found in granite rock west of the Kittilä village. The slide debris was similar to local tills, yet the maximum electrical conductivity ( a) anisotropy was incoherent to any of the iceflow (morphological) stages recognized through LiDAR or known fabric-sedimentary stratigraphy. We found peat/gyttja beneath 6 m of slide debris which yielded radiocarbon (14C) age of 4400 ± 35 BP (cal. 5055 yr BP). Our previous finding of landslide-buried woody remnants of birch (Betula ssp.) yielded cal. 9730 yr BP in Kittilä. These ages suggest that seismic activity has continued at least 5 ky after deglaciation.},

  abstract = {Firewood played an indispensable role in European socio-economic systems from prehistory until the nineteenth century. Recent research has shown that in European temperate lowlands the most important management form to produce firewood was coppicing. In spite of the growing body of research on traditional woodland management, there remain large gaps in knowledge. Detailed studies of individual sites or smaller areas have provided a wealth of information on the methods of medieval coppicing, and at such sites the long-term effects of coppicing on vegetation structure and composition have also been examined. However, little is known about the distribution and extent of coppicing at the landscape scale, and forming a coherent picture of the spatial extent rather than the management details of coppicing in larger regions remains a challenge. This paper investigates the distribution and extent of coppice management in Moravia (eastern Czech Republic, ca. 22,300 km2) in the Late Middle Ages. We created an extensive database of written sources that contained information on the presence of coppice woods at the parish level. Subsequently we used the MAXENT algorithm to create a model of the distribution of coppicing over the entire area. With the help of wood production and consumption estimates, we also calculated the minimum area of managed woodland for the study period. Results show that coppicing was predominant in the lowlands and often occurred at higher elevations as well, where neither natural conditions nor tree species composition were favourable. The paper also highlights the potential of spatial models based on archival data for historical landscape reconstructions.},

The studied rocks contain primary remanent magnetization recorded by hematite and display both polarities. The obtained inclination is slightly lower than expected for stable Europe, which could imply either minor latitudinal separation or come from the inclination error. The results from six sampling sites representing rocks situated in autochthonous cover of the crystalline basement and inclined only during the Neogene uplift imply 19° counterclockwise rotation. Considering the tectonic position of the studied rocks, this rotation could be attributed to the entire Tatra Block. In turn, results from rocks tilted in two tectonic events: during Late Cretaceous compression and further in Neogene uplift requires double tectonic correction as normal unfolding procedure results in spurious declination. It is suggested that the latter mechanism together with local rotations of allochthonous nappes may explain part of variable rotations reported in previous paleomagnetic studies of Mesozoic rocks from the Central Western Carpathians.},

The tendency of subsequent glaciations to obscure evidence of previous events makes it difficult to study the work done by past glacial episodes. Epiphreatic and paleophreatic caves that developed at or under the water table and dried out in response to valley deepening can serve as recorders of the valley incision history. U-series data from speleothems in the cave networks at the base of the present-day valleys in the Tatra Mountains (Western Carpathians) consistently yield the oldest ages of ca. 325\hspace{0.25em}ka. While speleothem ages are typically phreatic-vadose transition minimum ages, they nonetheless unequivocally demonstrate that neither glacial valley deepening nor fluvial incision occurred over the past 300\hspace{0.25em}ka, unlike the successive valley deepening over the same period in the adjacent Alps.},

Madograms are a geostatistical, variogram-­related concept, allowing for the analysis of altitude variability as a function of distance. After simple idealized digital elevation models were tested to reveal characteristic madogram shapes for various landform configurations, madograms were calculated for three frontal zones of different origin and morphology, located in the Sudetes range (Central Europe). Isopleth madograms and Ward's clustering method were applied to investigate similarities and differences within and between frontal zones. The results proved consistent with the accumulated, largely qualitative knowledge about geomorphology of the frontal zones and confirm the usefulness of the method, which allows for more insightful quantification of the morphology of mountain frontal zones, recognition of their internal spatial structure, and discrimination between fronts of various morphology and origin. Various recommendations for future users are also offered.},

  abstract = {A multidisciplinary geophysical survey, consisting of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), ground penetrating radar (GPR), shallow seismic refraction (SSR) and gravity survey (GS), was used to investigate the counter-slope scarps, one of the typical manifestations of the relaxed zones of rock massifs, and the possible initial stages of deep-seated landslides (DSLs). Two upper parts of the extensive DSLs within the Moravskoslezské Beskydy Mountains (Outer Western Carpathians – OWC) built by the sedimentary flysch rock were chosen as the testing sites. A combined geophysical survey on the flysch rocks was performed on both localities to enhance our present findings. The survey revealed that the ERT is able to reliably detect underground discontinuities, which are manifested at the ground surface by one of the typical landforms (tension cracks, trenches, pseudokarst sinkholes, double-crested ridges and counter-slope scarps). Previous studies suggested that bedrock discontinuities should be depicted by high-resistivity features within ERT surveying. According to SSR and GS, expected zones of weakened rock massif were not confirmed directly underneath the superficial landforms, but they were shifted. Based on the SSR and GS measurements, the depicted high-contrast transitions between high- and low-resistivity domains within the ERT profiles were newly identified as possible manifestation of bedrock discontinuities. The results of GPR measurements give only limited information on the sedimentary flysch rocks, due to shallow penetrating depth and locally strong signal attenuation. The combined results of multidisciplinary geophysical surveying confirmed an importance of employing more than one geophysical technique for integrated interpretations of measured data. Integrated interpretations of the measured geophysical data provided a new insight into massif disintegration and the geomorphic origin of the landforms related to the DSL.},

  abstract = {A power-law relation for the frequency–area distribution (FAD) of medium and large landslides (e.g. tens to millions of square meters) has been observed by numerous authors. But the FAD of small landslides diverges from the power-law distribution, with a rollover point below which frequencies decrease for smaller landslides. Some studies conclude that this divergence is an artifact of unmapped small landslides due to lack of spatial or temporal resolution; others posit that it is caused by the change in the underlying failure process. An explanation for this dilemma is essential both to evaluate the factors controlling FADs of landslides and power-law scaling, which is a crucial factor regarding both landscape evolution and landslide hazard assessment. This study examines the FADs of 45 earthquake-induced landslide inventories from around the world in the context of the proposed explanations. We show that each inventory probably involves some combination of the proposed explanations, though not all explanations contribute to each case. We propose an alternative explanation to understand the reason for the divergence from a power-law. We suggest that the geometry of a landslide at the time of mapping reflects not just one single movement but many, including the propagation of numerous smaller landslides before and after the main failure. Because only the resulting combination of these landslides can be observed due to a lack of temporal resolution, many smaller landslides are not taken into account in the inventory. This reveals that the divergence from the power-law is not necessarily attributed to the incompleteness of an inventory. This conceptual model will need to be validated by ongoing observation and analysis. Also, we show that because of the subjectivity of mapping procedures, the total number of landslides and total landslide areas in inventories differ significantly, and therefore the shapes of FADs also differ considerably. © 2018 The Authors.

  abstract = {In the last decade, a range of new remote-sensing techniques has led to a dramatic increase in terrain information, providing new opportunities for a better understanding of Earth surface processes based on geomorphic signatures. Technologies such as airborne and terrestrial lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) to obtain highresolution topography have opened avenues for the analysis of landslides, hillslope and channellization processes, river morphology, active tectonics, volcanic landforms and anthropogenic signatures on topography. This review provides an overview of the recent flourishing literature on high-resolution topographic analyses, underlining their opportunities and critical issues such as their limitations. The goal is to provide answers to questions such as what kind of processes can be analyzed through high-resolution topographic data and how to do it. The review focuses on two different environments: natural and engineered landscapes. In both contexts, high-resolution topography offers opportunities to better understand geomorphic processes from topographic signatures. Particular attention is given to engineered landscapes in which the direct anthropic alteration of processes is significant. The last part of the review discusses future challenges.},

A rigorous probability-based survey design specifies where to sample so that inferences from the sample apply to the entire population. Probability survey designs should be used in natural resource and environmental management situations because they provide the mathematical foundation for statistical inference. Development of long-term monitoring designs demand survey designs that achieve statistical rigor and are efficient but remain flexible to inevitable logistical or practical constraints during field data collection. Here we describe an approach to probability-based survey design, called the Reversed Randomized Quadrant-Recursive Raster, based on the concept of spatially balanced sampling and implemented in a geographic information system. This provides environmental managers a practical tool to generate flexible and efficient survey designs for natural resource applications. Factors commonly used to modify sampling intensity, such as categories, gradients, or accessibility, can be readily incorporated into the spatially balanced sample design.},

  abstract = {Slip rates across active faults and folds show that late Quaternary faulting is distributed across the central Tien Shan, not concentrated at its margins. Nearly every intermontane basin contains Neogene and Quaternary syntectonic strata deformed by Holocene north-south shortening on thrust or reverse faults. In a region that spans two thirds of the north-south width of the central Tien Shan, slip rates on eight faults in five basins range from ∼0.1 to ∼3 mm/yr. Fault slip rates are derived from faulted and folded river terraces and from trenches. Radiocarbon, optically stimulated luminescence, and thermoluminescence ages limit ages of terraces and aid in their regional correlation. Monte Carlo simulations that sample from normally distributed and discrete probability distributions for each variable in the slip rate calculations generate most likely slip rate values and 95\% confidence limits. Faults in basins appear to merge at relatively shallow depths with crustal-scale ramps that underlie mountain ranges composed of pre-Cenozoic rocks. The sum and overall pattern of late Quaternary rates of shortening are similar to current rates of north-south shortening measured using Global Positioning System geodesy. This similarity suggests that deformation is concentrated along major fault zones near range-basin margins. Such faults, separated by rigid blocks, accommodate most of the shortening in the upper crust.},

  abstract = {Modelling experiments of drainage events from proglacial lakes of the Río Baker catchment (central Patagonia, 46–48 ⁰S) indicate that Atlantic-Pacific drainage reversals may have caused freshwater forcing of regional climate. However, much of the region remains unmapped in detail and available geochronological data is equivocal, leading to multiple published palaeolake evolution models. We evaluate these models through new geomorphological mapping from the Baker valley; cosmogenic dating of moraine boulders that demonstrates an Antarctic Cold Reversal ice readvance that blocked drainage through the Río Baker; an altitudinal-based review of published geochronology; and regional analysis of shoreline glacio-isostasy and palaeolake levels. We use these datasets to present a new regional palaeolake evolution model underpinned by Bayesian age modelling. We demonstrate that 103\,km3 of freshwater was released to the Pacific over at least 6 drainage events from before 15.3–15.0\,cal\,yr BP to the early Holocene. The final stages of lake drainage involved catastrophic flooding along the Baker valley, evidenced by high magnitude flood landforms such as boulder bars, likely caused by failure of large valley floor moraine dams. We place these drainage events in the context of Late Quaternary meltwater pathways associated with advance/retreat of the Patagonian Ice Sheet and early human occupation across the region. Although broad patterns of ice retreat and lake formation may be similar across Patagonia, driven by Southern Hemisphere palaeoclimate, regional topographic settings likely resulted in spatial and temporal heterogeneity of Atlantic-Pacific drainage reorganisation across southernmost South America.},

We investigated the dynamics of gullies that have recently threatened dwellings and railways in the foreland of the Eastern Sudetes (340–390 m a.s.l. in the NE part of Czechia). Flood countermeasures in a residential area above the study site created conditions conducive to accelerated erosion in the gullies; thus, the main aim of this study was to determine how human interventions changed the spatio-temporal dynamics of the gullies during a short period. Twenty two gullies (with a mean length 48.5 m) have developed on a 1-km-wide escarpment (with a mean slope 25°) composed of glaciogenic sediments of various sizes. Dendrogeomorphic techniques were applied on 23 exposed roots of Tilia cordata Mill. (a tree species that has never been used to detect root exposure). Microsections were prepared using a G.S.L.1 sledge microtome and analysed using the WinCELL Reg software to determine the timing of root exposure.},

The complicated part is the calculation of cosmic radiation shielding by the escarpment body and the overlying wedge of the colluvial sediment. To improve reconstruction of earthquake ages and slip histories, we developed a mathematical model and corresponding MATLABÒ code for computation of shielding factor profiles in fault scarp geometry. In the model, cosmic radiation received by a point of footwall is represented as unit rays attenuated exponentially in scarp geometry. This approach allows producing very precise results both for the fault scarp and the sloped surface. The code is presented as a m-function and as a stand-alone program with a user-friendly interface. Shielding factors are calculated by the code for fast neutrons or for muons and include all general shieldings: topographical, sloped surface, fault scarp surface, colluvium cover, snow cover and self-shielding. A variety of input parameters enables one to adjust the model and the code to almost all possible shielding cases.

  abstract = {Large-scale landslides in the Himalaya are defined as huge, deep-seated landslide masses that occurred in the geological past. They are widely distributed in the Nepal Himalaya. The steep topography and high local relief provide high potential for such failures, whereas the dynamic geology and adverse climatic conditions play a key role in the occurrence and reactivation of such landslides. The major geoscientific problems related with such large-scale landslides are 1) difficulties in their identification and delineation, 2) sources of small-scale failures, and 3) reactivation. Only a few scientific publications have been published concerning large-scale landslides in Nepal. In this context, the identification and quantification of large-scale landslides and their potential distribution are crucial. Therefore, this study explores the distribution of large-scale landslides in the Lesser Himalaya. It provides simple guidelines to identify large-scale landslides based on their typical characteristics and using a 3D schematic diagram. Based on the spatial distribution of landslides, geomorphological/geological parameters and logistic regression, an equation of large-scale landslide distribution is also derived. The equation is validated by applying it to another area. For the new area, the area under the receiver operating curve of the landslide distribution probability in the new area is 0.699, and a distribution probability value could explain {$>$}65\% of existing landslides. Therefore, the regression equation can be applied to areas of the Lesser Himalaya of central Nepal with similar geological and geomorphological conditions.},

Finally, the authors explain the genesis of fossil speleothems found in abundance on the exposed walls of the former crevice-type caves. We essentially followed within our study two aspects: similarities met by the studied tectonic-karst corridors and typical bogaz, as classically described in literature, and their connection with the basic structural and tectonic frame. The spatial context of the described landforms was not ignored, as we constantly mentioned the role of compressional forces in building a favorable environment for their occurrence (Tîrlă and Vijulie, 2013). Neotectonics and structural frame, particularly the strike-slip fault systems, are the major control factors in driving the evolution of the Vânturariţa-Buila Massif and the formation of the bogaz-like forms. Supplementary evidences for attesting reverse and strike-slip faulting were provided. Slope failures by gravitational collapse prevail, and rotational landslides are only isolated. The origin of discussed exposed speleothems was correctly explained in the comment, except that they were formed on fault walls, not on fractures of gravitational origin.},

  abstract = {The relationship between surface karst development and the geological frame is widely acknowledged in the study of karst landforms. It is of considerable interest especially in alpine environments (e.g. Alpine–Dinaric–Carpathian orogenic system). Karst corridors are generally known as kluftkarren or bogaz and form by solution of limestone along a lithoclase network. The Vânturariţa-Buila Massif (Carpathians, Romania) is a typical alpine karst ridge and a former carbonate platform of Upper Jurassic age in which geologically-controlled karst features have been developing over a geologic timescale. Field research and mapping were useful in extracting geologic features. Joint- and structure-controlled karst corridors are common in the upper section of the mountain, between 1600 and 1850m. First, a complex system of lithoclases (fissures, joints and faults) occurred; then, surface runoff or meltwater solutionally enlarged them. Tension fractures strike in a northeast–southwest direction, parallel to homoclinal limestone layers. The exposed fault walls often preserve draperies and speleothem remnants. Further, statistical analysis of joint, fault and bogaz orientations has shown the close relation between the three datasets, and morphometric analysis centered only on the karst corridor system. Results derived from the statistical analysis of orientation data show that there is a strong preferred orientation of the bogaz or bogaz-like forms along the directional faults and that they commonly develop in extensional (tectonically active) environments. Additional features typical to fluviokarst are also present — subterranean connections between the karst corridors and the headwalls of the pocket valleys, generating headward recession both by continuous sapping of karst springs at the headwall base followed by collapses. An extremely poor surface drainage network developed in the upper pavement facing southeast, compared to that on the middle and lower sides.},

  abstract = {Layered limestones with marly–clayey interbeds are widespread in mountain regions. Where tectonics has not changed the original structure they frequently form homocline slopes, that since the last deglaciation have evolved through planar block slides along bedding joints. A typical dip slope showing this evolution is represented by the left flank of the Adige River valley south of Rovereto (North-Eastern Italy). Even though layers never daylight at the slope toe, the exceptional persistence and weakness of bedding joints allows buckling of layers, which occasionally collapse causing rock avalanches. Before monitoring started, deformations were believed to be no longer active, this conviction being strengthened by the high safety factors provided by limit equilibrium analyses. SAR satellite interferometry performed between 1990 and 2002 and probe inclinometer measures indicate that the slabs located uphill from the buckle folds are slowly sliding. Since some doubts have been raised about rock mass behaviour, slope geometry and hydraulic conditions assumed in the analyses, buckling was back-analysed using the Distinct Element Method (DEM) and the Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA). These treat the rock mass as a discontinuum and account for deformation and failure of the rock material. To perform numerical analyses, rock mass structure, strength and stiffness were determined through extensive in situ and laboratory investigations. For this purpose field surveys, borehole core logging and geophysical surveys were performed and laboratory geotechnical tests on the rock material, clayey interbeds and bedding joints were conducted. Discontinuous analyses confirmed that buckling deformations are definitely possible if some conditions are present (high water pressure, minor flexures). Modelling also indicate that buckling deformations may evolve into failures and should therefore be taken into account in evaluating long term stability of the slope.},

  abstract = {The present study analyses the spatial pattern of quaternary gravitational slope deformations (GSD) and historical/present-day instabilities (HPI) inventoried in the Swiss Rhone Valley. The main objective is to test if these events are clustered (spatial attraction) or randomly distributed (spatial independency). Moreover, analogies with the cluster behaviour of earthquakes inventoried in the same area were examined. The Ripley’s K-function was applied to measure and test for randomness. This indicator allows describing the spatial pattern of a point process at increasing distance values. To account for the non-constant intensity of the geological phenomena, a modification of the K-function for inhomogeneous point processes was adopted. The specific goal is to explore the spatial attraction (i.e. cluster behaviour) among landslide events and between gravitational slope deformations and earthquakes. To discover if the two classes of instabilities (GSD and HPI) are spatially independently distributed, the cross K-function was computed. The results show that all the geological events under study are spatially clustered at a well-defined distance range. GSD and HPI show a similar pattern distribution with clusters in the range 0.75–9 km. The cross K-function reveals an attraction between the two classes of instabilities in the range 0–4 km confirming that HPI are more prone to occur within large-scale slope deformations. The K-function computed for GSD and earthquakes indicates that both present a cluster tendency in the range 0–10 km, suggesting that earthquakes could represent a potential predisposing factor which could influence the GSD distribution.},

The bathymetry is produced using a combination of shipboard soundings and depths predicted using satellite altimetry. New data consists of {$>$}33.6 million multibeam and singlebeam measurements collated by several institutions, namely, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Geoscience Australia, Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. New altimetry data consists of 48, 14, and 12 months of retracked range measurements from Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, and Jason-2, respectively. With respect to SRTM15\_PLUS (Olson et al.,), the inclusion of these new data results in a ∼1.4-km improvement in the minimum wavelength recovered for sea surface free-air gravity anomalies, a small increase in the accuracy of altimetrically derived predicted depths, and a 1.24\% increase, from 9.60\% to 10.84\%, in the total area of ocean floor that is constrained by shipboard soundings at 15-arc sec resolution. Bathymetric grid cells constrained by satellite altimetry have estimated uncertainties of ±150 m in the deep oceans and ±180 m between coastlines and the continental rise. Onshore, topography data are sourced from previously published digital elevation models, predominately SRTM-CGIAR V4.1 between 60°N and 60°S. ArcticDEM is used above 60°N, while Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica is used below 62°S. Auxiliary grids illustrating shipboard data coverage, marine free-air gravity anomalies, and vertical gradient gradients are also provided in common data formats.},

This includes a correction to the production rate resulting from postglacial uplift of the Fennoscandian lithosphere (i.e. changing elevation) during the time of exposure. The error-weighted mean exposure age of 11 420 Â± 470 years of the analysed boulders agrees with previous varve dates of Ss I, which range from 11 680 to 11 430 calendar years BP. However, erosion has to be taken into account as a process affecting rock surfaces and therefore influencing exposure ages. Available information suggests an erosion rate of 5 mm/kyr, which increases the error-weighted mean exposure age to a value of 11 610 Â± 470 years. Within the errors, the formation of Ss I in the Vesala area west of Lahti falls into the Younger Dryas time bracket, as defined by the GRIP and GISP 2 ice core (Greenland).},

  abstract = {Fluvial undercutting can cause the large-scale destabilization of mountain slopes and induce deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DGSD) that eventually leads to catastrophic failures. This study analyses these processes in the catchment of the Dahan River, northern Taiwan. The area has experienced phases of river incision of up to 600 m since the middle to late Pleistocene, and middle Pleistocene paleosurfaces at higher elevations were incised to form V-shaped valleys. A DGSD inventory was compiled by visual interpretation of highresolution images, and field surveys were conducted to clarify the geological structures associated with DGSDs and major rockslide-avalanches. The observed relationships between DGSDs and the topography modified by long-term river incision show that about 53\% of all DGSDs occurred on slopes along the rims of paleosurfaces, which is approximately 2 and 2.5 times as many as in the incised valleys and on the paleosurfaces, respectively. A comparison of the power-law scaling exponents of cumulative frequency–area distributions shows that the frequency of DGSDs along the rims of the paleosurfaces decreases less rapidly with DGSD area than for DGSDs on other slopes. Geological investigations suggest that there are two dominant types of DGSD: one is flexural toppling of slate and argillite with high-angle cleavage, and the other is buckling of alternating beds of sandstone and mudstone on parallel or underdip cataclinal slopes. Catastrophic landslides observed along or below the rims of paleosurfaces were preceded by buckling of alternating beds of sandstone and shale. These beds dipped at 50° to 58°, and each bed was 10−1–100 m thick. This study suggests that the peripheral zones of the paleosurfaces may be most susceptible to future catastrophic landslides, particularly on parallel or underdip cataclinal slopes comprising alternating beds of sandstone and mudstone dipping at 50° to 60°. Thus, an understanding of the geological characteristics, spatial distribution of DGSD occurrence, and landscape evolution within a particular area can provide important information for landslide hazard-level zoning.},

  abstract = {Large numbers of landslides can be associated with a trigger, for example, an earthquake or a large storm. We have previously hypothesized that the frequency–area statistics of landslides triggered in an event are well approximated by a three-parameter inverse-gamma distribution, irrespective of the trigger type. The use of this general distribution was established using three substantially complete and well-documented landslide event inventories: 11,000 landslides triggered by the Northridge California Earthquake, 4000 landslides triggered by rapidly melting snow cover in the Umbria region of Italy, and 9000 landslides triggered by heavy rainfall associated with Hurricane Mitch in Guatemala. In this paper, we examine further this general landslide distribution by using an inventory of 165 landslides triggered by heavy rainfall in the region of Todi, Central Italy. Our previous studies have shown the applicability of our general landslide distribution to events with 4000–11,000 landslides. This smaller inventory provides a critical step in examining the applicability of the general landslide distribution. We find very good agreement of the Todi event with our general distribution. This also provides support for our further hypothesis that the mean area of landslides triggered by an event is approximately independent of the event size.},

Nephrotoxicity, which is usually reversible, is the most serious common adverse effect of vancomycin. Vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity prolongs hospital stays, imposes a need for additional antibiotics and, in rare circumstances, dialysis treatment, and increases medical costs and mortality. Risk factors for nephrotoxicity include the dose and duration of vancomycin treatment, serum trough concentration, patient characteristics, and concomitant receipt of nephrotoxins. Contemporary guidelines recommend targeting vancomycin trough concentrations of ≥10~mg/L to prevent resistance and trough concentrations of 15-20~mg/L to optimize outcomes. There is significant correlation between vancomycin trough serum concentrations and the incidence of vancomycin-associated nephrotoxicity; however, evidence of an association between trough concentrations and efficacy is less convincing. Routine monitoring of serum vancomycin concentrations consumes time and limited healthcare resources and may not be cost effective. The use of alternative antibacterial agents that do not require monitoring would free up pharmacy resources. This time could then be devoted to initiatives such as pharmacist-led antibiotic stewardship programs that are known to reduce antibiotic use and promote improved patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Soils and weathered bedrock have been known to slide simultaneously, with the resulting landslides sometimes moving rapidly and triggering debris flows. In this study, we refer to these landslides as deep-seated rapid (catastrophic) landslides (hereafter, DCLs). DCLs can result in serious damage, although the frequency of such disasters is generally low. Therefore, early warning systems and the construction of countermeasures for DCLs are important tools for disaster risk reduction. We analyzed the characteristics of recent storms that triggered DCLs in Japan. We found that several of these storms triggered multiple DCLs (multi-DCL events), although most triggered only a single DCL (single-DCL events). For short-term ({$<$}24 h) rainfall intensity, there was no significant difference in maximum rainfall intensities between storms that triggered single and multiple DCLs. Conversely, for long-term (48 or 72 h) rainfall amounts, storms that triggered multiple DCLs exhibited considerably higher rainfall amounts than storms that triggered no DCLs or a single DCL. In particular, more than 90\% of storms that triggered multiple DCLs recorded rainfall of more than 600 mm per 48 h. Our results suggest that the 48-h or 72-h rainfall amounts were effective for assessing temporal changes in DCL susceptibility, but not the 1-h to 24-h rainfall amounts. This indicates that the occurrence of DCLs is strongly controlled by long-term rainfall amounts but less strongly by short-term rainfall intensity.},

  abstract = {Quarrying of bedrock is a primary agent of subglacial erosion. Although the mechanical theory behind the process has been studied for decades, it has proven difficult to formulate the governing principles so that large-scale landscape evolution models can be used to integrate erosion over time. The existing mechanical theory thus stands largely untested in its ability to explain postglacial topography. In this study we relate the physics of quarrying to long-term landscape evolution with a multiscale approach that connects meter-scale cavities to kilometer-scale glacial landscapes. By averaging the quarrying rate across many small-scale bedrock steps, we quantify how regional trends in basal sliding speed, effective pressure, and bed slope affect the rate of erosion. A sensitivity test indicates that a power law formulated in terms of these three variables provides an acceptable basis for quantifying regional-scale rates of quarrying. Our results highlight the strong influence of effective pressure, which intensifies quarrying by increasing the volume of the bed that is stressed by the ice and thereby the probability of rock failure. The resulting pressure dependency points to subglacial hydrology as a primary factor for influencing rates of quarrying and hence for shaping the bedrock topography under warm-based glaciers. When applied in a landscape evolution model, the erosion law for quarrying produces recognizable large-scale glacial landforms: U-shaped valleys, hanging valleys, and overdeepenings. The landforms produced are very similar to those predicted by more standard sliding-based erosion laws, but overall quarrying is more focused in valleys, and less effective at higher elevations.},

For this purpose, three permafrost affected soil cores (down to 3 m depth) and seven active layer soil cores (down to 0.3 m depth) were sampled. The samples were divided into particular layers, which were analyzed separately. SOM stability was assessed using a simple chemical fractionation (sequential extraction by cold and hot water, and hot acid). SOM biodegradability and soil mineralization potentials were tested in shortterm laboratory incubations. The active layer contained 24 kg C mÀ2 and 70 kg C mÀ2 was preserved in 3 m of permafrost. The chemical quality and biodegradability of permafrost SOM were very similar to that of the active layer mineral horizon, and independent from depth. The only exceptions were (1) higher solubility of permafrost SOM in water, indicating its higher mobility and potential leakage after permafrost thawing and (2) higher nutrient (N, P) concentrations available to a dense permafrost microbial community, which could support decomposition of more complex substrates under suitable temperature conditions after thawing. The mineralization potential of the upper 1 m deep permafrost, which could melt by 2100 according to permafrost degradation models, was 6.7 g C mÀ2 dÀ1 (optimum conditions of 20 1C, field water capacity), which is comparable to that of the contemporary active layer of 0.5 m depth (7.5 g C mÀ2 dÀ1). Under field conditions, SOM mineralization rate would reasonably be significantly lower due to prevailing anoxia (high water table) and diffusion constraints in the deep and flooded soil profile.},

  abstract = {The ongoing debate over the effects of global environmental change on Earth’s cryosphere calls for detailed knowledge about process rates and their variability in cold environments. In this context, appraisals of the coupling between glacier dynamics and para-glacial erosion rates in tectonically active mountains remain rare. We contribute to filling this knowledge gap and present an unprecedented regional-scale inventory of supra-glacial sediment flux and hillslope erosion rates inferred from an analysis of 123 large ({$>$} 0Á1 km2) catastrophic bedrock landslides that fell onto glaciers in the Chugach Mountains, Alaska, as documented by satellite images obtained between 1972 to 2008. Assuming these supra-glacial landslide deposits to be passive strain markers we infer minimum decadal-scale sediment yields of 190 to 7400 t km–2 yr–1 for a given glacier-surface cross-section impacted by episodic rock–slope failure. These rates compare to reported fluvial sediment yields in many mountain rivers, but are an order of magnitude below the extreme sediment yields measured at the snouts of Alaskan glaciers, indicating that the bulk of debris discharged derives from en-glacial, sub-glacial or ice-proximal sources. We estimate an average minimum para-glacial erosion rate by large, episodic rock–slope failures at 0Á5–0Á7 mm yr–1 in the Chugach Mountains over a 50-yr period, with earthquakes likely being responsible for up to 73\% of this rate. Though ranking amongst the highest decadal landslide erosion rates for this size of study area worldwide, our inferred rates of hillslope erosion in the Chugach Mountains remain an order of magnitude below the pace of extremely rapid glacial sediment export and glacioisostatic surface uplift previously reported from the region.

Color influence and user errors, that usually characterize the trace mapping on images, are eliminated. Also trace sampling procedures based on circular windows and circular scanlines have been implemented: they are used to infer trace data and to calculate values of mean trace length, expected discontinuity diameter and intensity of rock discontinuities. The method is tested on a case study: results obtained applying the automatic procedure on the DSM of a rock face are compared to those obtained performing a manual sampling on the orthophotograph of the same rock face.},

  abstract = {Freely available global digital elevation models (DEMs) are important inputs for many research fields and applications. During the last decade, several global DEMs have been released based on satellite data. ASTER and SRTM are the most widely used DEMs, but the more recently released, AW3D30, TanDEM-X and MERIT, are being increasingly used. Many researchers have studied the quality of these DEM products in recent years. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of their quality over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. To provide this comparison, we examined the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four geographic regions with different topographic and land use conditions. We used local high-precision elevation models (Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Pleiades-1A) as reference models and all global models were resampled to reference model resolution (1m). In total, 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed. To estimate the accuracy, we generated error rasters by subtracting each reference model from the corresponding global DEM and calculated descriptive statistics for this difference (e.g., median, mean, root-mean-square error (RMSE)). We also assessed the vertical accuracy as a function of the slope, slope aspect, and land cover. We found that slope had the strongest effect on DEM accuracy, with no relationship for slope aspect. The AW3D30 was the most robust and had the most stable performance in most of the tests and is therefore the best choice for an analysis of multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also performed well where available, whereas NASADEM, as a successor of SRTM, showed only slight improvement in comparison to SRTM. MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well despite their lower spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {Landslide size controls the destructive power of landslides and is related to the frequency of occurrence, with larger landslides being less frequent than smaller ones. For this reason, the analysis of landslide size is essential for landslide hazard assessment. We analyse six earthquake-induced landslide inventories with earthquake magnitude ranging between 6.6 and 7.9 Mw (Papua New Guinea, 1993; ChiChi 1999; Northridge, 1994; Niigata–Chuetsu, 2004; Iwate–Miyagi Nairiku, 2008; Wenchuan, 2008). For each inventory, we developed magnitude–frequency curves to analyse the size distribution of landslides as a function of ground motion, distance from the seismic source (both fault trace and epicentre), local relief, and lithology. For three earthquakes, we observed a clear relationship between the landslide size and ground motion, with larger landslides associated with higher ground motion. We investigate different possible causes for such observation, and propose that the main mechanical reason is that stronger shaking induces higher stresses that may overcome the strength, which increases with depth, triggering larger landslides. We also show that landslide size decreases with distance from the fault trace, whereas, this trend is not clear for distance from the epicentre. Local relief does not seem a first order control on landslide size for the earthquake-induced landslides considered here. Some lithologies do influence landslide size, but we were unable to identify a general behaviour for different lithologies.},

The method is applied to the Séchilienne landslide in the French Alps, where precipitation and displacement have been monitored for 20 years. Wavelet analysis is first applied on precipitation and recharge as inputs and then on displacement time-series decomposed into trend and detrended signals as outputs. Results show that the detrended displacement is better linked to the recharge signal than to the total precipitation signal. The infra-annual detrended displacement is generated by high precipitation events, whereas annual and multi-annual variations are rather linked to recharge variations and thus to groundwater processes. This leads to conceptualise the system into a twolayer aquifer constituted of a perched aquifer (reactive aquifer responsible of high-frequency displacements) and a deep aquifer (inertial aquifer responsible of low-frequency displacements). In a second step, a new lumped model (GLIDE) coupling groundwater and a creep deformation model is applied to simulate displacement on three extensometer stations. The application of the GLIDE model gives good performance, validating most of the preliminary functioning hypotheses. Our results show that groundwater fluctuations can explain the displacement periodic variations as well as the long-term creep exponential trend. In the case of deep-seated landslides, this displacement trend is interpreted as the consequence of the weakening of the rock mechanical properties due to repeated actions of the groundwater pressure.},

Failure conditions in shallow landslides can occur when at a critical depth, which is determined by the cohesion of the soil and the slope angle, the moisture content in the soil becomes close to saturation, resulting in a considerable reduction of soil strength. Deeper landslides Ž5–20 m depth. are in most cases triggered by positive pore pressures on the slip plane induced by a rising ground water level.},

  abstract = {Similarities and differences in the processes and conditions of cryopediment formation are illustrated in two particular type regions. Cryopediment gradients range from 1–38 in the Czech Republic and from 0.03–0.058 in the lowlands of Belgium and the Netherlands, widths are from hundreds of metres to kilometres and underlying substrates vary from bedrock to unconsolidated sediment. The knickpoint between backslope and cryopediment surface is generally poorly developed on soft substrates but is sharp in bedrock substrates. Surface runoff, operating in sheets or concentrated, is inferred to have been the main process of sediment removal and transport on the cryopediment surface. The diversity in cryopediment morphology reflects the balance between the energy required and that available for transporting the sediment supplied. A resistant substrate produces relatively steep cryopediment gradients, and parallel backslope retreat may occur. In unconsolidated substrates, (very) low relief develops as a result of wash processes. Since large amounts of surface runoff cannot be generated on the highly permeable substrates, cryopediment surfaces must have developed under periglacial conditions with (thick) winter snow cover releasing meltwater in a short time over a frozen (and thus impermeable) soil. Due to repetitive periglacial conditions and progressive base-level lowering, some cryopediments may have developed polycyclically. Copyright \# 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Despite the availability of studies on the frequency density of landslide areas in mountainous regions, frequency–area distributions of historical landslide inventories in populated hilly regions are absent. This study revealed that the frequency–area distribution derived from a detailed landslide inventory of the Flemish Ardennes (Belgium) is significantly different from distributions usually obtained in mountainous areas where landslides are triggered by large-scale natural causal factors such as rainfall, earthquakes or rapid snowmelt. Instead, the landslide inventory consists of the superposition of two populations, i.e. (i) small (b 1–2 · 10−2 km2), shallow complex earth slides that are at most 30 yr old, and (ii) large (N 1–2 · 10− 2 km2), deep-seated landslides that are older than 100 yr. Both subpopulations are best represented by a negative power–law relation with exponents of −0.58 and −2.31 respectively. This study focused on the negative power–law relation obtained for recent, small landslides, and contributes to the understanding of frequency distributions of landslide areas by presenting a conceptual model explaining this negative power–law relation for small landslides in populated hilly regions. According to the model hilly regions can be relatively stable under the present-day environmental conditions, and landslides are mainly triggered by human activities that have only a local impact on slope stability. Therefore, landslides caused by anthropogenic triggers are limited in size, and the number of landslides decreases with landslide area.},

  abstract = {In contrast to the many studies that use expert-based analysis of LiDAR derivatives for landslide mapping in forested terrain, only few studies have attempted to develop (semi-)automatic methods for extracting landslides from LiDAR derivatives. While all these studies are pixel-based, it has not yet been tested whether objectoriented analysis (OOA) could be an alternative. This study investigates the potential of OOA using only singlepulse LiDAR derivatives, such as slope gradient, roughness and curvature to map landslides. More specifically, the focus is on both LiDAR data segmentation and classification of slow-moving landslides in densely vegetated areas, where spectral data do not allow accurate landslide identification. A multistage procedure has been developed and tested in the Flemish Ardennes (Belgium). The procedure consists of (1) image binarization and multiresolution segmentation, (2) classification of landslide parts (main scarps and landslide body segments) and non-landslide features (i.e. earth banks and cropland fields) with supervised support vector machines at the appropriate scale, (3) delineation of landslide flanks, (4) growing of a landslide body starting from its main scarp, and (5) final cleaning of the inventory map. The results obtained show that OOA using LiDAR derivatives allows recognition and characterization of profound morphologic properties of forested deep-seated landslides on soil-covered hillslopes, because more than 90\% of the main scarps and 70\% of the landslide bodies of an expert-based inventory were accurately identified with OOA. For mountainous areas with bedrock, on the other hand, creation of a transferable model is expected to be more difficult.},

The morphology of three landslides, including the 266.5 ha deep-seated gravitational slope deformation in Alden Biesen, was investigated in more detail. The analysis of the morphological and topographical characteristics (width–length relation, frequency–area distribution and topographical threshold) of the landslides revealed important differences compared to the characteristics reported in other landslide studies, and helped understanding possible landslide triggering mechanisms. Especially the possibility of a seismic origin of the landslides was investigated. Finally, a heuristic model for region-wide landslide susceptibility mapping was successfully tested. The susceptibility model and map allow prediction of future landslide locations and contribute to better understanding the role of individual causal factors on landslide location and spatial density. The results suggest that landslides on low-gradient, soilmantled hills are a more important contributor to landscape evolution of hilly areas than was hitherto thought. The morphology of all hilly regions of Flanders is clearly marked by landslide processes and higher landslide densities often coincide with the presence of quaternary active faults. This study further shows that high-resolution topographical data such as LiDAR significantly contributes to a better detection of old, previously unknown landslides.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, slope failures were reported in a 500 km2 study area in the Geba–Werei catchment, northern Ethiopia, a region where landslides were not considered an important hazard before. Field observations, however, revealed that many of the failures were actually reactivations of old deep-seated landslides after land use changes. Therefore, this study was conducted (1) to explore the importance of environmental factors controlling landslide occurrence and (2) to estimate future landslide susceptibility. A landslide inventory map of the study area derived from aerial photograph interpretation and field checks shows the location of 57 landslides and six zones with multiple landslides, mainly complex slides and debris flows. In total 14.8\% of the area is affected by an old landslide. For the landslide susceptibility modelling, weights of evidence (WofE), was applied and five different models were produced. After comparison of the models and spatial validation using Receiver Operating Characteristic curves and Kappa values, a model combining data on elevation, hillslope gradient, aspect, geology and distance to faults was selected. This model confirmed our hypothesis that deep-seated landslides are located on hillslopes with a moderate slope gradient (i.e. 5°–13°). The depletion areas are expected on and along the border of plateaus where weathered basalts rich in smectite clays are found, and the landslide debris is expected to accumulate on the Amba Aradam sandstone and upper Antalo limestone. As future landslides are believed to occur on inherently unstable hillslopes similar to those where deep-seated landslides occurred, the classified landslide susceptibility map allows delineating zones where human interventions decreasing slope stability might cause slope failures. The results obtained demonstrate that the applied methodology could be used in similar areas where information on the location of landslides is essential for present-day hazard analysis.},

  abstract = {A landslide inventory is the most important information source for quantitative zoning of landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk. It should give insight into the location, date, type, size, activity and causal factors of landslides as well as resultant damage. In Europe, many countries have created or are creating national and/or regional landslide databases (LDBs). Yet little is known on their contents, completeness, format, structure, language use and accessibility, and hence on their ability to perform national or transnational landslide zoning. Therefore, this study presents a detailed analysis of existing national LDBs in the EU member states, EU official candidate and potential candidate countries, and EFTA countries, and their possible use for landslide zoning. These national LDBs were compared with a subset of 22 regional databases. Twenty-two out of 37 contacted European countries currently have national LDBs, and six other countries have only regional LDBs. In total, the national LDBs contain 633,696 landslides, of which 485,004 are located in Italy, while Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, and the UK also have {$>$} 10,000 landslides in their LDBs. National LDBs are generally created in the official language of each country and 58\% of them contain other natural hazards (e.g. floods and sinkholes). About 68\% of the LDBs contain less than 50\% of all landslides in each country, but a positive observation is that 60\% of the LDBs are updated at least once a year or after a major event. Most landslide locations are collected with traditional methods such as field surveys, aerial photo interpretation and analysis of historical records. Currently, integration of landslide information from different national LDBs is hampered because of differences in language and classification systems for landslide type and activity. Other problems are that currently only half of the national LDBs have a direct link between spatial and alphanumeric information, and that public access is generally restricted or limited. A minimum set of features to be included in national LDBs is suggested, and a flow chart is presented that classifies European countries by ability to perform national-scale landslide susceptibility, hazard and risk analyses.},

  abstract = {In many regions, the absence of a landslide inventory hampers the production of susceptibility or hazard maps. Therefore, a method combining a procedure for sampling of landslideaffected and landslide-free grid cells from a limited landslide inventory and logistic regression modelling was tested for susceptibility mapping of slide- and flow-type landslides on a European scale. Landslide inventories were available for Norway, Campania (Italy), and the Barcelonnette Basin (France), and from each inventory, a random subsample was extracted. In addition, a landslide dataset was produced from the analysis of Google Earth images in combination with the extraction of landslide locations reported in scientific publications. Attention was paid to have a representative distribution of landslides over Europe. In total, the landslide-affected sample contained 1,340 landslides. Then a procedure to select landslide-free grid cells was designed taking account of the incompleteness of the landslide inventory and the high proportion of flat areas in Europe. Using stepwise logistic regression, a model including slope gradient, standard deviation of slope gradient, lithology, soil, and land cover type was calibrated. The classified susceptibility map produced from the model was then validated by visual comparison with national landslide inventory or susceptibility maps available from literature. A quantitative validation was only possible for Norway, Spain, and two regions in Italy. The first results are promising and suggest that, with regard to preparedness for and response to landslide disasters, the method can be used for urgently required landslide susceptibility mapping in regions where currently only sparse landslide inventory data are available.},

  abstract = {Geomorphological maps provide information on the relief, genesis and shape of the earth’s surface and are widely used in sustainable spatial developments. The quality of geomorphological maps is however rarely assessed or reported, which limits their applicability. Moreover, older geomorphological maps often do not meet current quality requirements and require updating. This updating is time-consuming and because of its qualitative nature difficult to reproduce, but can be supported by novel computational methods. In this paper, we address these issues, by 1) quantifying the uncertainty associated with manual geomorphological mapping, 2) exploring the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for semi-automated geomorphological mapping, and 3) testing the sensitivity of CNNs to uncertainties in manually created evaluation data. We selected a test area in the Dutch push-moraine district with a pronounced relief and a high variety of landforms. For this test area we developed five manually created geomorphological maps and 27 automatically created landform maps using CNNs. The resulting manual maps are similar on a regional level. We could identify the causes of disagreement between the maps on a local level, which often related to differences in mapping experience, choices in delineation and different interpretations of the legend. Coordination of mapping efforts and field validation are necessary to create accurate and precise maps. CNNs perform well in identifying landforms and geomorphological units, but fail at correct delineation. The human geomorphologist remains necessary to correct the delineation and classification of the computed maps. The uncertainty in the manually created data that are used to train and evaluate CNNs have a large effect on the model performance and evaluation. This also advocates for coordinated mapping efforts to ensure the quality of manually created training and test data. Further model development and data processing are required before CNNs can act as standalone mapping techniques.},

  abstract = {Relationships between riverbed morphology, concavity, rock type and rock uplift rate are examined to independently unravel the contribution of along-strike variations in lithology and rates of vertical deformation to the topographic relief of the Oregon coastal mountains. Lithologic control on river profile form is reflected by convexities and knickpoints in a number of longitudinal profiles and by general trends of concavity as a function of lithology. Volcanic and sedimentary rocks are the principal rock types underlying the northern Oregon Coast Ranges (between 46°30′ and 45°N) where mixed bedrock–alluvial channels dominate. Average concavity, θ, is 0·57 in this region. In the alluviated central Oregon Coast Ranges (between 45° and 44°N) values of concavity are, on average, the highest (θ = 0·82). South of 44°N, however, bedrock channels are common and θ = 0·73. Mixed bedrock–alluvial channels characterize rivers in the Klamath Mountains (from 43°N south; θ = 0·64). Rock uplift rates of ≥0·5 mm a−1, mixed bedrock–alluvial channels, and concavities of 0·53–0·70 occur within the northernmost Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains. For rivers flowing over volcanic rocks θ = 0·53, and θ = 0·72 for reaches crossing sedimentary rocks. Whereas channel type and concavity generally co-vary with lithology along much of the range, rivers between 44·5° and 43°N do not follow these trends. Concavities are generally greater than 0·70, alluvial channels are common, and river profiles lack knickpoints between 44·5° and 44°N, despite the fact that lithology is arguably invariant. Moreover, rock uplift rates in this region vary from low, ≤0·5 mm a−1, to subsidence ({$<$}0 mm a−1). These observations are consistent with models of transient river response to a decrease in uplift rate. Conversely, the rivers between 44° and 43°N have similar concavities and flow on the same mapped bedrock unit as the central region, but have bedrock channels and irregular longitudinal profiles, suggesting the river profiles reflect a transient response to an increase in uplift rate. If changes in rock uplift rate explain the differences in river profile form and morphology, it is unlikely that rock uplift and erosion are in steady state in the Oregon coastal mountains.

  abstract = {Hagedoorn developed the plus-minus method with the objective of providing the exploration world with a simple and rapid approximation of Thornburgh's wavefront reconstruction method. Straightforward adding and subtracting produces depths and velocities at all geophones where the refracted waves from a set of reciprocal shots are first arrivals. Even though seismic refraction has not kept up with the revolutionary advance of reflection technology during the past decades, the method still has a lot to offer, especially in shallow engineering, and environmental, groundwater and sea-bed surveying. Its strong points are the ease of application, the low costs, the effectiveness in the shallow zone, the unique ability to provide detailed velocity information on the deepest refractor and the capability for producing parameters for layer and rock characterization.Because of its simplicity, the plus-minus method is ideally suited for real-time processing of refraction data in the field, thus monitoring the data quality and the optimal shot configuration. Today, such field processing is easily performed with a laptop and dedicated software. matlab® is a software package that enables tailor-made processing, offering a combination of a programming language, visualization tools and a large library of ready-made functions. This paper presents a plus-minus program developed in matlab and illustrates its application with a case study in Yemen, where seismic refraction was used in a regional groundwater study.

  abstract = {Greenish glauconitic sandstones from the Middle Member of the Godula Formation of the Outer Western Carpathians flysch belt represent traditional building stone used in the north-eastern part of the Czech Republic and adjoining part of south Poland for about a thousand years. Despite the longstanding history of their utilisation in constructions and monuments, the amount of information about properties, durability and places of use is given in the existing literature only to a very limited extent. The Godula sandstones under study exhibit a high bulk density (up to 2610~kg/m3), relatively low water absorption capacity (0.7–3.0 wt\%) and total porosity (1.7–9.4\%), high values of P-wave velocity within psammitic rocks (3120–4290~m/s), and high to very high strength (uniaxial compressive strength 102.7–155.8~MPa, splitting tensile strength 4.0–10.0~MPa). However, in contrast to high quality of stone properties, the degree of their durability especially in the case of exterior use may often be very low, and stone deterioration can frequently advance very rapidly. Godula sandstones are characterised by a significant dominance of pores with diameter smaller than 1~μm. The character of pore space represents the principal and general reason of Godula sandstone deterioration susceptibility. Deterioration rate and specific weathering forms are subsequently strongly affected, in detail, by the heterogeneity of the mineralogical composition and anisotropy of rock texture within the individual sandstone bed. The data about composition, properties and stability of the Godula sandstones published in this paper could help architects or designers to understand the decay causes experienced by these types of sandstones and how to prevent them and may also serve as a guide for restoration and conservation works.},

  abstract = {Since the development of SIMS and LA-ICP-MS technologies in the 1980s and 1990s, single grain U–Pb dating of detrital zircon has quickly become the most popular technique for sedimentary provenance studies. Currently by far the most widespread method for visualising detrital age distributions is the so-called Probability Density Plot (PDP), which is calculated by summing a number of Gaussian distributions whose means and standard deviations correspond to the individual ages and their respective analytical uncertainties. Unfortunately, the PDP lacks a firm theoretical basis and can produce counter-intuitive results when data quantity (number of analyses) and/or quality (precision) is high. As a more robust alternative to the PDP, this paper proposes a standard statistical technique called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), which also involves summing a set of Gaussian distributions, but does not explicitly take into account the analytical uncertainties. The Java-based DensityPlotter program (http://densityplotter.london-geochron.com) was developed with the aim to facilitate the adoption of KDE plots in the context of detrital geochronology.},

From such theoretical curves, theoretical valley floors (bedrocks) were modeled. Multiple methods were used for calculation of valley floor accumulations volume. The most probable calculated volume for Velka Studena valley is 41 652 890 m3. Mala Studena valley is represented by volume of 32 116 275 m3, which means 73 769 165 m3 for both valleys. In connection with the shape of some theoretical curves, range of volumes from 45 248 360 m3 to 73 769 165 m3 was also proposed. Because the modeled valley floors and calculated volumes were obtained only by GIS investigation, it would be desirable to perform also geophysical field measurements, which open possibilities for more precise estimation.},

  abstract = {Rapid, field-based measurements of rock hardness are of use in investigating many geomorphological and heritage science problems. Several different methods are now available for taking such measurements, but little work has been done to assess their comparability and strengths and weaknesses. We review here the capabilities of two types of Schmidt Hammer (Classic N type and Silver Schmidt BL type) alongside two types of Equotip (standard type D and Piccolo) for investigating rock hardness in relation to rock weathering on various types of sandstone and limestone, as well as basalt and dolerite. Whilst the two Schmidt hammers and the two Equotips show comparable results when tested at 15 individual sites, interesting differences are found between the Equotip and Schmidt Hammer values which may reveal information about the nature of weathering on different surfaces. Operator variance is shown to be an issue in particular for the Equotip devices, which also exhibit higher variability in measurements and necessitate larger sample sizes. Carborundum pre-treatment also has varying effects on the data collected, depending on the nature of the surface studied. The Equotip devices are shown to be particularly useful on smaller blocks and in situations where edge effects may affect Schmidt Hammer readings. We conclude that whilst each device contributes to geomorphological research, they do not necessarily produce comparable information. Indeed, using Schmidt Hammer and Equotip in combination and looking at any differences in results may provide invaluable insights into the structure of the near-surface zones and the nature of weathering processes.

  abstract = {A multidisciplinary approach has been adopted to study the slope movements and landscape evolution at the archaeological site of Machu Picchu and its immediate surroundings. The basic event in the paleogeomorphological evolution of the area was the large-scale slope movement, which destroyed the originally higher ridge between Mt. Machupicchu and Mt. Huaynapicchu. Within remnants of that primary deformation, several younger generations of slope movements occurred. The laboratory analyses of granitoids revealed highly-strained zones on the slopes of Mt. Machupicchu, which strongly affect the largest slope deformation. The borders of the largest slope deformation are structurally predisposed by the existence of fault zones. The majority of various types of slope movements on the so-called Front Slope (E facing) and Back Slope (W facing) are influenced by the alignment between topography and joints. Along with slope movements, fluvial erosion and tectonic disturbance of the rocks have been affecting the evolution of the landscape. A monitoring network for dilatometric and extensometric measurements was used to detect the present-day activity of rock displacements within the archaeological site. In addition to standard mapping of surface hydrogeological phenomena, eleven express slug tests were conducted to verify the infiltration potential of precipitation. The results of these surveys indicate that recent large-scale slope movement as suggested by some previous studies is doubtful, and the detected movements can be explained by individual movements of rock blocks or several other mechanisms including sinking of archaeological structures, subsurface erosion and annual changes in the water content of the soils.},

  abstract = {The Krbavčići landslide occurred in January 1979 near the town of Buzet, Croatia, after a long period of heavy rainfall. It is located in Northern Istria in the area built of flysch rock mass where numerous mass movements in the past and recent history have been recorded. A flysch rock mass is highly susceptible to weathering, which leads to material disintegration, changes in geotechnical properties, and shear strength decrease, finally resulting in instability processes in flysch slopes. This paper describes existing information about the Krbavčići landslide occurrence, laboratory testing of siltstone samples from a flysch rock mass, and numerical slope stability analyses of a possible landslide reactivation caused by possible long rainy periods and further weathering of the flysch rock mass. Slope stability analysis using the Rocscience, Slide software, as well as landslide numerical simulations using the LS-Rapid simulation software were performed on the basis of the digital elevation model (DEM) and laboratory test results of siltstones with different weathering grades. A DEM of the Krbavčići landslide was obtained on the basis of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) survey conducted in March 2016. The residual shear strength of siltstones to predict a reactivation of landslides is of highest importance and was determined by ring shear and direct shear tests on siltstone samples with different weathering grades. The results of the numerical simulations show that an increase of the groundwater level in the landslide body in combination with the further weathering of the flysch rock material at the sliding surface would have the main influence on a possible landslide reactivation and the further development of the landslide displacement.},

  abstract = {The Cenozoic structure of the Western Carpathians is strongly controlled by faults. The E-W striking Vikartovce fault is one of the most distinctive dislocations in the region, evident by its geological structure and terrain morphology. This feature has been assumed to be a Quaternary reactivated fault according to many attributes such as its perfect linearity, faceted slopes, the distribution of travertines along the fault, and also its apparent prominent influence on the drainage network. The neotectonic character of the fault is documented herein by morphotectonic studies, longitudinal and transverse valley profile analyses, terrace system analysis, and mountain front sinuosity. Late Pleistocene activity of the Vikartovce fault is now proven by luminescence dating of fault-cut and uplifted alluvial sediments, presently located on the crest of the tilted block. These sediments must slightly pre-date the age of river redirection. Considering the results of both luminescence dating and palynological analyses, the change of river course probably occurred during the final phase of the Riss Glaciation (135± 14 ka). The normal displacement along the fault during the Late Quaternary has been estimated to about 105—135 m, resulting in an average slip rate of at least 0.8—1.0 mm · yr—1. The present results identify the Vikartovce fault as one of the youngest active faults in the Central Western Carpathians.},

Paleostress analysis of brittle and semibrittle structures of the Eocene—Oligocene succession of the Central Carpathian Paleogene Basin (CCPB) supplemented by measurements in the Triassic sequence of the Krížna Nappe, revealed the existence of six tectonic regimes during the Cenozoic. Orientation of the paleostress field before the deposition of the CCPB was characterized by the E-W oriented compression. After this compression, the paleostress field rotated approximately 40—50°, and NW—SE directed compression took place in the Early Miocene. During the latest Early Miocene, the extensional tectonic regime with fluctuation of σ3 orientation between NW-SE to NE-SW dominated. The Late Badenian—Pannonian is characterized by a new compressive to strike-slip tectonic regime during which the principal maximum stress axis σ1 progressively rotated from a NW-SE to a NE-SW position. Uplift and tilting of the Tatra Massif took place during this stage. The neotectonic stage (Pliocene to Holocene) is characterized by extensional tectonic regime with the two directions of tension. The first one is oriented in the E-W direction and could be considered older and the second one, NNW-SSE tension is considered to be Late Pliocene to Quaternary in age. In general, orientation of the stress fields shows an apparent clockwise rotation from the Oligocene to Quaternary times. This general clockwise rotation of the Oligocene to Quaternary paleostress fields could be explained by both the effect of the counter-clockwise rotation of the ALCAPA microplate and by the regional stress field changes.},

  abstract = {The study of a sample of river sediment enables the determination of spatially averaged denudation rates that provide an exceptional perspective on erosion and weathering processes that have taken place within a landscape. These measurements are done with in-situ produced cosmogenic nuclides (e.g. 10Be, 26Al), mostly in quartz from alluvial sediment. Cosmogenic nuclides are produced when secondary cosmic rays interact with the very uppermost layer of the Earth's surface. They are produced within a characteristic depth scale of about 1 m, which means that the measured concentrations record an integrated denudation history while material passed through this depth interval. Depending on the denudation rate the resulting integration time scales are 103 to 105 years, and one obtains a robust long-term estimate of natural denudation that is relatively insensitive to short-term changes. The last 10 years have seen significant research activity using these methods, and an array of fascinating tectono-geomorphologic and geochemical insights are emerging. Amongst these is the ability to identify the physical and chemical processes with which a landscape responds to tectonic activity or climate change. A compilation of world-wide denudation rates in non-glaciated areas, that however, does not yet include some of the world's most active mountain belts, has resulted in the following findings, some of which have been unexpected: (1) No obvious relationship between precipitation or mean annual temperature and total denudation is apparent. (2) Topographic relief alone does not result in high rates of denudation. (3) Denudation rates are high in areas of landscape rejuvenation; that is triggered and controlled by tectonic activity (faulting, escarpment formation and retreat, rifting, surface uplift). (4) Rates of weathering (using a combination of cosmogenic nuclides and zirconium-normalised cation loss balances) co-vary primarily with physical erosion rates and much less with temperature or precipitation. (5) In some areas of high land use short-term rates (from river load gauging) exceed those from cosmogenic nuclides by several orders of magnitude, which serves to highlight the severity of geomorphic change caused by human action. In the future, the control mechanisms over denudation will be determined on all spatial scales, ranging from the single soil section to entire river basins. The same analysis can be done back through time on well-dated terraces, lake records, and marine sediment cores, which is possible with 10Be for the past 1–2 My. The rates obtained will be used to develop a quantitative understanding of tectonic, geomorphologic, and geochemical landscape processes, which in turn is a prerequisite to design and calibrate models of the response of landscapes to tectonic, climate, and anthropogenic forcing.},

From an ecological point of view, they represent an important ecosystem disturbance, especially in tropical montane forests. Here, shallow translational landslides are a frequent natural phenomenon and one local determinant of high levels of biodiversity. In this paper, we apply weighted ensembles of advanced phenomenological models from statistics and machine learning to analyze the driving factors of natural landslides in a tropical montane forest in South Ecuador. We exclusively interpret terrain attributes, derived from a digital elevation model, as proxies to several driving factors of landslides and use them as predictors in our models which are trained on a set of five historical landslide inventories. We check the model generality by transferring them in time and use three common performance criteria (i.e. AUC, explained deviance and slope of model calibration curve) to, on the one hand, compare several state-of-the-art model approaches and on the other hand, to create weighted model ensembles. Our results suggest that it is important to consider more than one single performance criterion.},

  abstract = {The transition zone of the Eastern Alps to the Pannonian Basin provides one of the best sources of information on landscape evolution of the Eastern Alpine mountain range. The region was non-glaciated during the entire Pleistocene. Thus, direct influence of glacial carving as a landscape forming process can be excluded and relics of landforms are preserved that date back to at least the Late Neogene. In this study, we provide a correlation between various planation surfaces across the orogen-basin transition. In particular, we use stream terraces, planation surfaces and cave levels that cover a vertical spread of some 700 m. Our correlation is used to show that both sides of the transition zone uplifted together starting at least about 5 Ma ago. For our correlation we use recently published terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (TCN) burial ages from cave sediments, new optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages of a stream terrace and U–Th ages from speleothems. Minimum age constraints of cave levels from burial ages of cave sediments covering the last \textasciitilde{} 4 Ma are used to place age constraints on surface features by parallelizing cave levels with planation surfaces. The OSL results for the top section of the type locality of the Helfbrunn terrace suggest an Early Würm development (80.5 ± 3.7 to 68.7 ± 4.0 ka). The terrace origin as a penultimate gravel deposit (in classical Alpine terminology Riss) is therefore questioned. U-series speleothem ages from caves nearby indicate formation during Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5c and 5a which are both interstadial warm periods. As OSL ages from the terrace also show a time of deposition during MIS 5a ending at the MIS 5/4 transition, this supports the idea of temperate climatic conditions at the time of deposition. In general, tectonic activity is interpreted to be the main driving force for the formation and evolution of these landforms, whilst climate change is suggested to be of minor importance. Obvious hiatuses in Miocene to Pleistocene sediments are related to ongoing erosion and re-excavation of an uplifting and rejuvenating landscape.},

  abstract = {We report the first incision rates derived from burial ages of cave sediments from the Mur river catchment at the eastern margin of the Eastern Alps. At the transition zone between the Alpine orogen and the Pannonian basin, this river passes through the Paleozoic of Graz — a region of karstifiable rocks called the Central Styrian Karst. This river dissects the study area in a north–south direction and has left behind an abundance of caves. These caves can be grouped into several distinct levels according to their elevation above the present fluvial base level. Age estimates of abandoned cave levels are constrained by dating fluvial sediments washed into caves during the waning stages of speleogenesis with the terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide method. These ages and the elevations of the cave levels relative to the current valley floor are used to infer a very complex history of 4 million years of water table position, influenced by the entrenchment and aggradation of the Mur river. We observe rather low rates of bedrock incision over the last 4 Ma (in the order of 0.1 mm/y) with an e-folding decrease in this trend to lower rates at younger times. We relate this incision history to a tectonic setting where an increase of drainage area of the Mur river due to stream piracy in Late Miocene to Pliocene times is linked to surface uplift. The later decrease in valley lowering rates is attributed to the rise of the base level related to aggradation of sediments within the valley. Sediment transport through the valley from the upstream section of the Mur river limited the erosional potential of the river to a transport limited state at the later stages of the incision history.},

  abstract = {This discussion paper, by a Working Group of INTIMATE (Integration of ice-core, marine and terrestrial records) and the Subcommision on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), considers the prospects for a formal subdivision of the Holocene Series/Epoch. Although previous attempts to subdivide the Holocene have proved inconclusive, recent developments in Quaternary stratigraphy, notably the definition of the Pleistocene–Holocene boundary and the emergence of formal subdivisions of the Pleistocene Series/ Epoch, mean that it may be timely to revisit this matter. The Quaternary literature reveals a widespread but variable informal usage of a tripartite division of the Holocene (‘early’, ‘middle’ or ‘mid’, and ‘late’), and we argue that this de facto subdivision should now be formalized to ensure consistency in stratigraphic terminology. We propose an Early–Middle Holocene Boundary at 8200 a BP and a Middle–Late Holocene Boundary at 4200 a BP, each of which is linked to a Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP). Should the proposal find a broad measure of support from the Quaternary community, a submission will be made to the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), via the SQS and the ICS, for formal ratification of this subdivision of the Holocene Series/Epoch.

The basal fault scarp is rejuvenated by vertical movements recurring at intervals on the order of 10 000 years. Fault scarps in colluvium that lie within a few tens of meters of the base of faceted spurs remain clearly recognizable for only a few tens of thousand years. Initial fault-scarp slopes of 50° to 90° are replaced by debris-controlled slopes of 30° to 37° within a few thousand years. In fractured bedrock, slope angles in the range of 25° to 35° remain relatively stable for hundreds of thousands of years and account for the relative stability of facets on spurs. Piedmont slopes are greatly affected by tectonic tilting or warping toward or away from the range front. The formation of pediments is believed to result from a low ratio of uplift relative to downcutting. A few million years is required for the development of a pediment a few kilometers wide.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic collapse of large rock slopes ranks as one of the most hazardous natural phenomena in mountain landscapes. The cascade of events, from rock-slope failure, to rock avalanche and the near-immediate release of debris flows has not previously been described from direct observations. We report on the 2017, 3.0×106m3 failure on Pizzo Cengalo in Switzerland, which led to human casualties and significant damage to infrastructure. Based on remote sensing and field investigations, we find a change in critical slope stability prior to failure for which permafrost may have played a destabilizing role. The resulting rock avalanche traveled for 3.2km and removed over one million m3 of glacier ice and debris deposits from a previous rock avalanche in 2011. Whereas this entrainment did not lead to an unusually large runout distance, it favored debris flow activity from the 2017 rock avalanche deposits: the first debris flow occurred with a delay of 30s followed by ten debris flows within 9.5h and two additional events two days later, notably in the absence of rainfall. We hypothesize that entrainment and impact loading of saturated sediments explain the initial mobility of the 2017 rock avalanche deposits leading to a near-immediate initiation of debris flows. This explains why an earlier rock avalanche at the same site in 2011 was not directly followed by debris flows and underlines the importance of considering sediment saturation in a rock avalanche’s runout path for Alpine hazard assessments.},

  abstract = {Large earthquakes in active mountain belts can trigger landslides, which mobilize large volumes of clastic sediment. Delivery of this material to river channels may result in aggradation and flooding, while sediment residing on hillslopes may increase the likelihood of subsequent landslides and debris flows. Despite recognition of these processes, the controls on the residence time of coseismic landslide sediment in river catchments remain poorly understood. Here we assess the residence time of fine-grained ({$<$}0.25 mm) landslide sediment mobilized by the C.E. 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake, China, using daily suspended sediment discharge measured in 16 river catchments from 2006–2012. Following the earthquake, suspended sediment discharge was elevated 3–7× compared to 2006–2007. However, the total 2008–2012 export (92.5 ± 9.3 Mt from 68,719 km2) was much less than estimates of fine-grained sediment input by coseismic landslides (480 +350/–338 Mt) determined by landslide area-volume scaling and deposit grain-size distributions. We estimate the residence time of fine-grained sediment in the affected river catchments using the post-earthquake rate of sediment export, and find that it ranges from one year to over a century. The first-order variability in fine-sediment residence time is proportional to the areal extent of coseismic landsliding, and is inversely proportional to the frequency of intense runoff events ({$>$}5 mm day–1). Together with previous observations from the C.E. 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, our results demonstrate the importance of landslide density and runoff intensity in setting the duration of earthquaketriggered landslide impacts on river systems.},

  abstract = {Special features were correlated to the geological causes of the Chiu-fen-erh-shan landslide, a gigantic rockslide on a dip slope, induced by the Chi-chi earthquake (ML = 7.3) in central Taiwan in 1999. An aerial photo interpretation and the succeeding geological mapping of the failure were employed in this study. A linear depression, a steep step, and a low drainage density in the landslide area were detected from the aerial photos taken in 1998. The gravitational creep was believed to result in the features of the linear depression and the low drainage density. The steep step represented a buckling feature found in the field. The landslide area is composed of stratified sandstone and shale, with dip angles ranging 20 – 36j. The slip surface developed along a pre-existing bedding fault that resulted from flexural slip folding. Before the Chi-chi earthquake, the rock on the upslope side buckled and was retained by a thick-bedded sandstone downslope. The earthquake shock seriously damaged the sandstone support and led to the catastrophic landslide. This type of landslide is likely to occur on the moderately dipping slope of stratified rocks that were previously deformed by flexural slip folding.},

Three IRSL protocols were used, involving both the additive-dose with thermal transfer correction and regeneration methods, and from four samples using both the additive-dose method and the single aliquot regeneration method. Eight luminescence ages of between and 16.1 ± 1.6 and 10.0 ± 0.9 kyr date the most extensive and youngest fluvial aggradation surface that has been deformed by Wairarapa Fault, the most active fault of the North Island Dextral Shear Zone. The ages provide absolute rates of dextral and vertical slip on the fault over the last ∼ 30 kyr that deforms two aggradation surfaces; an average horizontal slip rate of 11.5 ± 0.5 mm/yr and variable vertical slip rates of between 0.09 and 1.7 mm/yr that correlate with compressional bulges developed on the upthrown side of the fault caused by left-lateral sidesteps, and reversals of the upthrown side of the fault. The horizontal slip rate indicates that one third of the ∼ 33 mm/yr strike-slip motion of oblique convergence between the Australian and Pacific plates is taken up by the Wairarapa Fault. Three younger luminescence ages of b 10 kyr provide evidence for post-youngest aggradation surface fan development and date a possible earthquake.},

Between this period and the modern warming a remarkable negative temperature trend occurred in the Northern Hemisphere, which was probably the effect of a decreasing orbital-induced insolation during the boreal summer. On average the Northern Hemisphere humidity–precipitation records do not show any significant trend. A mechanistic explanation for the multi-decadal- to century-scale Holocene cold relapses, which mainly occurred in the Atlantic–European regions, exists for only the early Holocene cooling events, which are probably the result of a collapse of the meridional overturning circulation owing to freshwater outbursts from the Laurentide ice sheet. Possibly, the late Holocene cold events after c. 4\,ka BP are influenced by the covarying influence of major tropical volcanic eruptions and Grand Solar Minima.},

Previous tsunami ball applications restricted attention to landslide-generated sea waves and local runup. For the first time, we expand the approach to include overland flows and floods in a dam-break like situation. The Vaiont landslide was not a debris avalanche, but rather a semi-coherent slump. The slump versus avalanche distinction is embodied with a 2-D variation of a particulate landslide model. With proper adjustment of landslide parameters, we find that a slump of dimension and volume consistent with observations can indeed slip from the south slope of the reservoir, splash water -200 m up on the north slope, spill 30 million m\textbackslash n                        3 of water over the dam and flood the valley below - all as were recorded in that day's events. Incorporating runup and flood information with geological data provides additional insight into the kinematics of the landslide. The observed distribution of inundation requires that the eastern part of the landslide begin to move before the western part, so trapping and pushing more water over the dam than would otherwise have been the case. As aids for visualization, this paper includes links to Quicktime movies of the simulations, including a three dimensional "fly by".},

The landslide began within an \textasciitilde 200-m-high hillslope comprised of unconsolidated glacial and previous landslide/colluvial deposits; it continued as a debris avalanche/debris flow that rapidly inundated a neighborhood of 35 single-family residences. An intense three-week rainfall that immediately preceded the event most likely played a role in triggering the landslide; and other factors that likely contributed to destabilization of the landslide mass include alteration of the local groundwater recharge and hydrogeological regime from previous landsliding, weakening and alteration of the landslide mass caused by previous landsliding, and changes in stress distribution resulting from removal and deposition of material from earlier landsliding. Field reconnaissance following the event revealed six distinctive zones and several subzones that are characterized on the basis of geomorphic expression, styles of deformation, geologic materials, and the types, size, and orientation of vegetation. Seismic recording of the landslide indicate that the event was marked by several vibrationgenerating episodes of mass movement. We hypothesize that the landslide occurred in two stages, with the first being a sequential remobilization of existing slide masses from the most recent (2006) landslide and from an ancient slide that triggered a devastating debris avalanche/debris flow. The second stage involved headward extension into previously unfailed material that occurred in response to unloading and redirection of stresses.},

The angular relationships between the resultant of sand shifting winds and both the crest and principal slipfaces of the elemental types have been discussed qualitatively for many decades. These relationships have been quantified but the wide range of dune types that combine the elemental forms, and the juxtaposition of different dune types, show that wind regime is not the only determinant; for example, sand availability has been considered important. We have now quantified the importance of both wind regime and sand availability as determinants of dune type. We show here that the four elemental types occur in areas uniquely defined by both the equivalent sand thickness of sediments held in the dunes and a measure of directional variability of sand-moving winds. Wind strength does not appear to be important, vegetation has an ambiguous role, and the particle size of dune sediments is unimportant.},

Widespread occurrence of shattered leucogranites and migmatites deposited discordantly on top of undisturbed augen gneisses, and separated by micro-brecciated sliding surfaces indicate rapid movement during a large rockslide event. Occurrence of frictionite (= hyalomylonite) in mineral samples indicates short-term temperatures of \textasciitilde{} 600 °C in the moving rockslide mass along a 12° sliding plane. From a SW direction of movement we infer a source 8 km NE of the deposit, \textasciitilde{} 5 km S of Pandim (6691 m a.s.l.), where today a thick leucogranite intrusion marks a zone of weakness and failure of a postulated former mountain crest. The mechanism of movement, the dip of the sliding surface, and the deposit preservation along ridge tops require that the Dzongri rockslide ran out over an ice-filled Prek Chu valley. Hence, we prefer earthquake shaking over undercutting and glacial debuttressing as a possible trigger mechanism. A regional review of other similarly large and catastrophic Himalayan rockslides indicates that leucogranite intrusions are highly conducive to large-scale failure in the Higher Himalayan Crystalline (HHC). Importantly, high erosion rates have rendered this large rockslide deposit undetectable by remote sensing or digital elevation data, which are commonly used for identifying evidence of such extreme events. Quantifying the contribution of such giant landslides in destroying some of the highest relief on Earth will thus need further research attention.},

  abstract = {The growing body of research on large-scale mass wasting events so far has only scarcely investigated the sedimentology of chaotic deposits from non-volcanic terrestrial landslides such that any overarching and systematic terminological framework remains elusive. Yet recent work has emphasized the need for better understanding the internal structure and composition of rockslide deposits as a means to characterise the mechanics during the final stages of runout and emplacement. We offer a comprehensive overview on the occurrence of rock fragmentation and frictional melt both at different geographic locations, and different sections within large ({$>$}106 m3) rockslide masses. We argue that exposures of pervasively fragmented and interlocked jigsaw-cracked rock masses; basal mélange containing rip-up clasts and phantom blocks; micro-breccia; and thin bands of basal frictionite are indispensable clues for identifying deposits from giant rockslides that may remain morphologically inconspicuous otherwise. These sedimentary assemblages are diagnostic tools for distinguishing large rockslide debris from macroand microscopically similar glacial deposits, tectonic fault-zone breccias, and impact breccias, and thus help avoid palaeoclimatic and tectonic misinterpretations, let alone misestimates of the hazard from giant rockslides. Moreover, experimental results from Mössbauer spectroscopy of frictionite samples support visual interpretations of thin sections, and demonstrate that short-lived ({$<$}10 s) friction-induced partial melting at temperatures {$>$}1500 ◦C in the absence of water occurred at the base of several giant moving rockslides. This finding supports previous theories of dry excess runout accompanied by comminution of rock masses down to μm-scale, and indicates that catastrophic motion of large fragmenting rock masses does not require water as a potential lubricant.},

That is why giant failures of mountain crests have mainly occurred in areas of tectonic activity. The mechanism of failure, and displacement of the resulting large mass movements also strongly depends on this litho-tectonic predesign and continues in giant translational rockslides in which the primary rock structure or fabric is preserved, but shattered by mechanical stress during the sliding event.},

To simulate these phenomena, physical model tests were performed in the laboratory under simplified environmental conditions. Subsequently, the discrete element method was employed in simulations to elucidate the deformation behavior exhibited by slate slopes under the long-term influence of gravity and material deterioration. The physical model tests revealed two types of gravitational deformation of slate slopes. The first type is flexural toppling, which was observed in obsequent slopes with high-angle foliation. The second type is fold extrusion near the slope toe; this was exhibited by consequent slopes with low-angle foliation and is attributable to gravitation and deterioration caused by wetness. The results of the physical model test were used to verify the results of the discrete element simulation. The simulated deforming patterns were in strong agreement with the actual deformation at various slope angles. Regarding the factors influencing slope deformation, the simulation showed that the fold in consequent slopes became sharper and the folding area increased as the foliation angle increased; moreover, the folding area rose as the slope angle increased. In obsequent slopes, higher slope and foliation angles induced more substantial flexural toppling deformation.},

  abstract = {A consequent slope comprises weak planes in the same dip direction along a slope face. This study investigated scale effects on the gravitational deformation of consequent slopes. A series of centrifuge model tests under simplified environmental conditions were performed. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was then adopted to evaluate the displacement distribution from the centrifuge model test results. On the basis of the PIV results, the relationship between slope deformation and surface settlement was investigated. Subsequently, the discrete element method (DEM) was used to execute simulations to provide detailed descriptions of the crack development and failure mechanisms associated with consequent slopes at different scales. The results of this study are summarized as follows. (1) The slopes exhibited similar deformation patterns in the centrifuge model tests. As the gravitational force increased, the magnitude of slope deformation increased significantly. (2) A modified dimensional relationship of material parameters was proposed for DEM simulation. According to this relationship, the simulated deformation patterns were in strong agreement with the actual deformations at various slope scales. (3) According to the DEM simulations, for the slopes with the same slope and weak plane angles, more cracks and displacements were generated in the higher slopes, leading to a greater sliding volume.},

  abstract = {The concentration of 10Be in detrital quartz (10Beqtz) from river sediments is now widely used to quantify catchment-wide denudation rates but may also be sensitive to inputs from bedrock landslides that deliver sediment with low 10Beqtz. Major landslide-triggering events can provide large amounts of low-concentration material to rivers in mountain catchments, but changes in river sediment 10Beqtz due to such events have not yet been measured directly. Here we examine the impact of widespread landslides triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake on 10Beqtz in sediment samples from the Min Jiang river basin, in Sichuan, China. Landslide deposit material associated with the Wenchuan earthquake has consistently lower 10Beqtz than in river sediment prior to the earthquake. River sediment 10Beqtz decreased significantly following the earthquake downstream of areas of high coseismic landslide occurrence (i.e., with greater than ∼0.3\% of the upstream catchment area affected by landslides), because of input of the 10Be-depleted landslide material, but showed no systematic changes where landslide occurrence was low. Changes in river sediment 10Beqtz concentration were largest in small first-order catchments but were still significant in large river basins with areas of 104–105 km2. Spatial and temporal variability in river sediment 10Beqtz has important implications for inferring representative denudation rates in tectonically active, landslide-dominated environments, even in large basins. Although the dilution of 10Beqtz in river sediment by landslide inputs may complicate interpretation of denudation rates, it also may provide a possible opportunity to track the transport of landslide sediment. The associated uncertainties are large, but in the Wenchuan case, calculations based on 10Be mixing proportions suggest that river sediment fluxes in the 2–3 years following the earthquake increased by a similar order of magnitude in the 0.25–1 mm and the {$<$}0.25 mm size fractions, as determined from 10Beqtz mixing calculations and hydrological gauging, respectively. Such information could provide new insight into sediment transfer, with implications for secondary sediment-related hazards and for understanding the removal of mass from mountains.},

Rock slides and rock falls have been more numerous than debris slides, debris flows, and miscellaneous slumps. Rock fails have produced the largest cumulative volume of deposits. About half of slope movements had unreported or unrecognized triggering events. Earthquakes and rain storms individually accounted for the greatest cumulative volumes of deposits from recognized triggers of all types of historical slope movements; snowmelt, human activities and freeze-thaw conditions accounted for only a small proportion of the volumes from reported triggers. A comparison of the historical and postglacial average annual rates of deposition from slope-movement processes in a portion of the Yosemite Valley indicates that, during the period 1851-1992, slope-movement processes have been producing about half the average rate of deposits than during the past 15,000 3,ears.},

The debris initially moved directly downslope but was deflected from this course on contact with the glacier and was channelled along its margin. Debris deposition on an oblique alignment across a 25–308 slope was icesupported. With glacier wastage the debris settled, opening a sinuous longitudinal tension furrow. The lower, older part of the debris tongue, aligned along the comb floor, may also have an association with glacier ice and was likely sourced from a different area of the comb. Parts of both areas of the debris tongue are underlain by fine-grained materials attributed to glacial deposition. This is one of very few rock avalanche deposits in Great Britain for which a direct association with glacier ice can be demonstrated, a sparsity at odds with what might be expected.},

  abstract = {Cosmogenic isotope (10Be and 26Al) surface exposure dating has been applied to valley-axis and hillslope stone runs (relict periglacial block streams) and their source outcrops in the Falkland Islands, South Atlantic. The data indicate that stone runs are considerably older landforms than previously envisaged and afford no evidence that they are a product of the Last Glacial Maximum; the samples range in apparent 10Be age from 42k to 731k yr BP, but some of these are minima. The results indicate that valley-axis stone runs may be up to 700–800k yr old, have simple exposure histories and are composite landforms that developed over several cold stages. Analyses of some hillslope and outcrop samples also demonstrate simple exposure histories with 10Be ages from 42k to 658k yr BP. In contrast, isotopic ratios from other hillslope and outcrop samples reveal they have had a complex exposure history involving periods of burial or shielding; the samples range in 10Be age from 59k to 569k yr BP and these are regarded as minimum age estimates. Larger stone runs may be older than smaller runs and there is a possibility that stone runs older than 800k yr exist in other parts of the Falklands. The assertion that glaciation in the Falklands was restricted to the highest uplands is supported by the data, and the potential for age determination of other boulder-strewn and bedrock landforms, using cosmogenic isotope analysis, in order to extend the geochronology of Quaternary events and processes is noted.

  abstract = {An extensive accumulation of rock debris at the mouth of Urdadalen in the Jotunheimen, southern Norway, is interpreted as the deposit of a rock-slope failure (sturzstrom). This is the first large-scale rock-slope failure to be recognised in the Jotunheimen but is unlikely to be the only one. The debris descended to the valley floor, passed across the valley axis and moved 40 m up the opposite side of the valley. Some debris passed over the lip of Urdadalen and now forms a boulder tongue that extends for c. 800 m into Utledalen. A maximum velocity of 80 m s–1 for debris movement from crest of hillside to toe of boulder tongue has been estimated, and a minimum velocity of 28 m s–1 was required for the debris to run up the opposite side of Urdadalen. The degree of boulder hardness/weathering as determined by Schmidt hammer suggests the sturzstrom occurred in the Late Holocene (1.825 ± 0.76 cal. ka BP), during a period of climatic deterioration. The localised geomorphological impact of the failure event has been to dam the valley and create a small lake, to cause valley widening, to produce a north-facing hillside embayment at 1200–1400 m above sea level with the potential to collect and retain snow that might, in future, lead to niche glacier development and cirque initiation, and to provide a large volume of rock debris for entrainment and onward transport in future glacial cycles.},

  abstract = {There are numerous examples of the impact of strong earthquakes on landslide activity. There is however very little information about the ability of low-magnitude earthquakes (M {$<$} 5.0) to affect the stability of pre-existing landslide slopes. Two landslides were studied (Hołowiec and Kamień, Western Carpathians, Poland). These are located 20–30 km from seismoactive zones where earthquakes of M ≤ 4.4 occur. We have used tree rings to date past landslide movements possibly caused by earthquakes. We have dated events of tree tilting by landslide activity, after which the trees developed eccentric rings and reaction wood, in a sample of 40 Norway spruces (Hołowiec) and 51 European silver firs (Kamień). The results of dendrochronological dating were compared with the occurrence of earthquakes in the study area (magnitudes, epicentral distance, etc.). We have also analysed precipitation data to help to disentangle the impact of rainfall and earthquakes as triggering factors. We were able to distinguish: earthquake-triggered landsliding with no impact of precipitation, precipitation-triggered landsliding with no seismic impact and landsliding triggered by the overlapping impact of precipitation and earthquakes. The results show that the combination of both triggering factors has the strongest influence on the stability of landslides under study. The study demonstrates the ability of low-magnitude (M {$<$} 5.0) earthquakes to trigger landslide activity, even at distances larger than appears from limiting curves published for co-seismic landslides. The results also suggest that the activity of the Kamień landslide can possibly be influenced by the long-distance (over 500 km) influence of strong earthquakes (M 6.8–7.4) from outside of the study area. The study demonstrates that the seismic factor, both local, low-magnitude earthquakes and distant, strong earthquakes, can be an important trigger of landslide activity. Their role may be underestimated in the study area and other areas considered as seismically non-active or of low seismic activity.},

  abstract = {Mountain streams are here defined as channel networks within mountainous regions of the world. This definition encompasses tremendous diversity of physical and biological conditions, as well as history of land use. Human effects on mountain streams may result from activities undertaken within the stream channel that directly alter channel geometry, the dynamics of water and sediment movement, contaminants in the stream, or aquatic and riparian communities. Examples include channelization, construction of grade-control structures or check dams, removal of beavers, and placer mining. Human effects can also result from activities within the watershed that indirectly affect streams by altering the movement of water, sediment, and contaminants into the channel. Deforestation, cropping, grazing, land drainage, and urbanization are among the land uses that indirectly alter stream processes. An overview of the relative intensity of human impacts to mountain streams is provided by a table summarizing human effects on each of the major mountainous regions with respect to five categories: flow regulation, biotic integrity, water pollution, channel alteration, and land use. This table indicates that very few mountains have streams not at least moderately affected by land use. The least affected mountainous regions are those at very high or very low latitudes, although our scientific ignorance of conditions in low-latitude mountains in particular means that streams in these mountains might be more altered than is widely recognized. Four case studies from northern Sweden (arctic region), Colorado Front Range (semiarid temperate region), Swiss Alps (humid temperate region), and Papua New Guinea (humid tropics) are also used to explore in detail the history and effects on rivers of human activities in mountainous regions. The overview and case studies indicate that mountain streams must be managed with particular attention to upstream/downstream connections, hillslope/channel connections, process domains, physical and ecological roles of disturbance, and stream resilience.},

  abstract = {"Rivers are the great shapers of terrestrial landscapes. Very few points on Earth above sea level do not lie within a drainage basin. Even points distant from the nearest channel are likely to be influenced by that channel. Tectonic uplift raises rock thousands of meters above sea level. Precipitation falling on the uplifted terrain concentrates into channels that carry sediment downward to the oceans and influence the steepness of adjacent hill slopes by governing the rate at which the landscape incises. Rivers migrate laterally across lowlands, creating a complex topography of terraces, floodplain wetlands and channels. Subtle differences in elevation, grain size, and soil moisture across this topography control the movement of ground water and the distribution of plants and animals"--},

They are evident in map view rather than in vertical sections. Examples of duplexes are cited from both active and ancient systems and from theoretical and physical models. Duplexes may form at bends on strike-slip faults by a process kinematically analogous to the sequential imbrication of ramps on dip-slip faults. However some may form, and many may initiate, as non-sequential 'Riedel' fractures at fault offsets or on straight fault segments. This process is more marked than in dip-slip systems where primary anisotropy such as bedding exerts more control on fault geometry.},

  abstract = {Techniques and issues are considered surrounding the characterisation of surface form represented by Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). A set of software tools suitable for use in a raster based Geographical Information System (GIS) is developed. Characterisation has three specific objectives, namely to identify spatial pattern, to identify scale dependency in form and to allow visualisation of results. An assessment is made of the characteristics of error in DEMs by identifying suitable quantitative measures and visualisation processes that may be enabled within a GIS. These are evaluated by contour threading a fractal surface and comparing four different spatial interpolations of the contours. The most effective error characterisations are found to be those that identify high frequency spatial pattern. Visualisation of spatial arrangement of DEM error is used to develop a deterministic error model based on local surface slope and aspect. DEMs are parameterised using first and second derivatives of quadratic surfaces fitted over a range of scales. This offers advantages over traditional methods based on a 3 by 3 local window, as geomorphometric form can be characterised at any scale. Morphometric parameters are combined to give a feature classification that may also be applied over a range of scales. Multi-scale measurements are combined to give a feature membership function that describes how properties change with scale. These functions are visualised using modal and entropy measures of variability. An additional method of visualising scale dependency is suggested that graphically represents statistical measures of spatial pattern over a variety of spatial lags. This is found most appropriate for detecting structural anisotropy in a surface. Characterisation tools are evaluated by applying them to uncorrelated surfaces, fractal surfaces and Ordnance Survey DEMs of Lake District, Peak District and Dartmoor.},

Here we present the development of a new regional landslide inventory (RI) for the European Alps. This database provides a substantial temporal and spatial picture of landsliding in the Alps, with particular focus on the Swiss and French Alps. We use segmented models to evaluate recording bias in the temporal record. We use scaling relationships to calculate landslide area based on a given volume for similar types of landslide; with the result of this being that 9.5\% of the landslides recorded in the RI now have area data recorded. These landslide area data are then used to examine the log–linear trend, which exists between landslide area and frequency in inventories. We show that this relationship is present for this historical dataset; however, none of the individual databases, nor a unification of these, contain a complete record with the small and larger landslides being recorded more consistently. The use of segmented models on the temporal distribution of landslides in the RI shows that the post-1970 portion of the database is more reliable, highlighted through an improved power–law relationship, although the frequency of medium sized landslides is still underestimated. We show that creating a unified database (RI) can increase the reliability of datasets and consistency in recording for the use by researchers for attribution and detection studies.},

Evidence of past debris flows was found at all recent debris flow sites. Orographic rainfall enhancement along topographic escarpments influenced debris flow frequency at higher elevations. A possible trigger for the Wayah and fatal Peeks Creek debris flows was a spiral rain band within Ivan that moved across the area with short duration rainfall rates of 150–230 mm/h. Intersecting bedrock structures in polydeformed metamorphic rock influence the formation of catchments within structural–geomorphic domains where debris flows originate.},

  abstract = {Large wood exerts a beneficial influence on the functioning of riverine and riparian ecosystems but can be also the source of flood risk. Several studies have recognised a trend of decreasing amounts of large wood on unit channel area with increasing width of mountain streams. This study verifies whether this trend can also be generalised for wide mountain rivers. Longitudinal wood distribution was compared for two watercourses in the Polish Carpathians: second- to fourth-order Kamienica Stream, 14 m wide on average, and the fifth-order Czarny Dunajec River with a mean width of 52 m. In the stream, both the number and the mean mass of wood deposits were unrelated to channel width, and this was reflected in a lack of the relationship between total wood storage (the amount of stored wood per channel length) and channel width. In turn, specific wood storage (the amount of stored wood per channel area) decreased nonlinearly with increasing channel width. In the wide Czarny Dunajec, the number and the mean mass of wood deposits increased as the river widened, and this was reflected in a marked trend of increasing total wood storage with increasing river width. Here, the width-related variation in total wood storage was so high that it overcame the influence of increasing channel area on calculated values of specific wood storage, which also increased with increasing river width. This study shows that different mechanisms known to govern large wood retention in the channels narrower and wider than the height of riparian trees are reflected in the contrasting patterns of wood storage in mountain watercourses of different relative width. Different relations between the tendencies of total and specific wood storage in the two types of channels emphasise the need of identifying the spatial density and the total amount of large wood.},

  abstract = {The May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake of China (Mw 7.9 or Ms 8.0) triggered hundreds of thousands of landslides. Mapping such a large number of landslides is a major task, considering the large size of the affected area and the availability of pre- and postearthquake remote sensing images. This paper compares three (nearly) complete landslide inventories that were compiled from visual image interpretation. The three inventories differ in the manner in which the landslides are represented, either as polygons, centroid points, or top points. Landslides in the three inventories use one-toone correspondence. Each of the three inventories includes a large proportion of the 197,481 landslides triggered by the earthquake. These landslides were delineated as individual solid polygons and points using visual interpretation of high-resolution aerial photographs and satellite images acquired following the earthquake and verified by selected field checking throughout a broad area of approximately 110,000km2. These landslides cover a total area of approximately 1,160km2. Based on the inventories of landslide polygons and landslide centroid points, two types of density maps were constructed. Correlations of landslide occurrence with seismic, geologic, and topographic parameters were analyzed using the three landslide inventories. Statistical analysis of their spatial distribution was performed using both the landslide area percentage (LAP), defined as the percentage of the area affected by the landslides and the landslide number density (LND), defined as the number of landslides per square kilometer. There are two types of LNDs: the LND-centroid (based on the centroid point of the landslide) and the LND-top (based on the top point of the landslide). We used the three indexes to determine how the occurrence of the landslides correlates with elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, slope position, slope curvature, lithology, distance from the epicenter, seismic intensity, distance from the Yingxiu-Beichuan surface fault rupture, peak ground acceleration (PGA), and coseismic surface displacements (including horizontal, vertical, and total displacements). Both the LAP and the two types of LND values were observed to have continuous positive or negative correlations with the slope angle, slope curvature, distance from the epicenter and from the Yingxiu-Beichuan surface fault rupture, seismic intensity, and coseismic surface displacement. In addition, the highest values of the LAP and LND values appear at ranges from 1,200 to 3,000m in elevation. Moreover, the landslides have preferred orientations, dominated by the eastern, southeastern, and southern directions. In addition, the sandstone, siltstone (Z), and granitic rocks experienced more concentrated landslides. No obvious correlations were observed between the LAP and LND values and slope position. Finally, we studied the orders of eight earthquake-triggered landslide impact factor effect on landslide occurrence.},

The empirical equations developed indicated the Schmidt hardness rebound values have a reliable relationship with the uniaxial compressive strength of rock (r = 0.92). Comparing the results with those reported by other researchers, it is concluded that no single relationship can be considered reliable for all rock types.

  abstract = {Landslides are a major type of geohazards claiming thousands of casualties and billions of dollars in property damages every year. Catastrophic landslide activities are often triggered by some extreme events such as earthquakes, excessive precipitations, or volcanic eruptions. Quickly identifying the spatial distribution of landslides induced by these extreme events is crucial for coordinating rescue efforts and planning in situ investigations. In this study, we propose an automated method for detecting the spatial distribution of earthquake-triggered landslides by examining after-event vegetation changes. Central to this method is the use of pre- and post-event remote sensor images covering the same area. Geometric correction and radiometric normalization are performed before deriving a vegetation index from each image. Then, an image differencing procedure is applied to the two derived indices. With the resultant difference image, an initial landslide distribution map is generated by highlighting the pixels with a threshold percentage decrease in the brightness values as a direct result of the image subtraction. The threshold percentage value is interactively determined by using a visual interpretation method. The final landslide distribution map is produced after using a modal filter to suppress boundary errors in the initial map. This method has been implemented in a test site, approximately 30 km from the epicenter of the Sichuan earthquake (7.9 Ms) that struck on 12 May 2008. A pre-event Thematic Mapper image and a post-event Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer scene are used. The thematic accuracy assessment indicates that 90\% of the landslides have correctly been mapped. Given the relatively simple procedures and the good mapping accuracy, the image processing and change detection method identified in this study seems to be promising from an operational perspective.},

While cosmogenic radionuclides (CRN) represent a valuable tool to document basin-averaged erosion rates, a better understanding of CRN dynamics in these systems is required before erosion rates can be reliably inferred from CRN concentrations. The stochastic nature of landslides results in variability of CRN concentrations in both alluvial and hillslope samples that is both difficult to document and poorly understood. To guide sampling strategies, we developed a 2-D plan view model to simulate the influence of landslides on CRN dynamics. We employ a sediment mixing model, in which concentrations of CRNs from material eroded by both landslides and steady processes are combined to evaluate how best to infer erosion rates from CRN concentrations. This model is further used to test a new analytical solution for the distribution of CRN concentrations on hillslopes in a landslide-prone system. Results suggest that for landscapes dominated by deep ({$>$}5 m) landslides, only large drainage basins (≥100 km2) provide consistently reliable estimates of erosion rates from CRN concentrations. For landscapes dominated by shallow landslides (0.7–2 m), smaller basins can produce reliable estimates. Results further suggest that the distribution of concentrations from hillslope samples could be used to deduce the relative contribution of material derived from landslide and steady processes. These findings underscore the need to consider carefully the sources of natural variability in sampling and analyzing CRNs; if properly done, the variability can reveal useful information about geomorphic processes in landslide-prone areas.},

  abstract = {The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms=8.0; epicenter located at 31.0° N, 103.4° E), with a focal depth of 19.0 km was triggered by the reactivation of the Longmenshan fault in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province, China on 12 May 2008. This earthquake directly caused more than 15,000 geohazards in the form of landslides, rockfalls, and debris flows which resulted in about 20,000 deaths. It also caused more than 10,000 potential geohazard sites, especially for rockfalls, reflecting the susceptibility of high and steep slopes in mountainous areas affected by the earthquake. Landslide occurrence on mountain ridges and peaks indicated that seismic shaking was amplified by mountainous topography. Thirty-three of the high-risk landslide lakes with landslide dam heights greater than 10 m were classified into four levels: extremely high risk, high risk, medium risk, and low risk. The levels were created by comprehensively analyzing the capacity of landslide lakes, the height of landslide dams, and the composition and structure of materials that blocked rivers. In the epicenter area which was 300 km long and 10 km wide along the main seismic fault, there were lots of landslides triggered by the earthquake, and these landslides have a common characteristic of a discontinuous but flat sliding surface. The failure surfaces can be classified into the following three types based on their overall shape: concave, convex, and terraced. Field evidences illustrated that the vertical component of ground shaking had a significant effect on both building collapse and landslide generation. The ground motion records show that the vertical acceleration is greater than the horizontal, and the acceleration must be larger than 1.0 g in some parts along the main seismic fault. Two landslides are discussed as high speed and long runout cases. One is the Chengxi landslide in Beichuan County, and the other is the Donghekou landslide in Qingchuan County. In each case, the runout process and its impact on people and property were analyzed. The Chengxi landslide killed 1,600 people and destroyed numerous houses. The Donghekou landslide is a complex landslide–debris flow with a long runout. The debris flow scoured the bank of the Qingjiang River for a length of 2,400 m and subsequently formed a landslide dam. This landslide buried seven villages and killed more than 400 people.},

Openness is an angular measure of the relation between surface relief and horizontal distance. For angles less than 90", it is equivalent to the internal angle of a cone, its apex at a DEM location, constrained by neighboring elevations within a specified radial distance. Openness incorporates the terrain line-of-sight, or viewshed, concept and is calculated from multiple zenith and nadir angles-here along eight azimuths. Openness has two viewer perspectives. Positive values, expressing openness above the surface, are high for convex forms, whereas negative values describe this attribute below the surface and are high for concave forms. Openness values are mapped by gray-scale tones. The emphasis of terrain convexity and concavity in openness maps facilitates the interpretation of landforms on the Earth's surface and its seafloor, and on the planets, as well as features on any irregular surface-such as those generated by industrial procedures},

  abstract = {The productivity of the Amazon rainforest is constrained by the availability of nutrients, in particular phosphorus (P). Deposition of long-range transported African dust is recognized as a potentially important but poorly quantified source of phosphorus. This study provides a first multiyear satellite-based estimate of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin using three-dimensional (3-D) aerosol measurements over 2007–2013 from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). The 7 year average of dust deposition into the Amazon Basin is estimated to be 28 (8–48) Tg a−1 or 29 (8–50) kg ha−1 a−1. The dust deposition shows significant interannual variation that is negatively correlated with the prior-year rainfall in the Sahel. The CALIOP-based multiyear mean estimate of dust deposition matches better with estimates from in situ measurements and model simulations than a previous satellite-based estimate does. The closer agreement benefits from a more realistic geographic definition of the Amazon Basin and inclusion of meridional dust transport calculation in addition to the 3-D nature of CALIOP aerosol measurements. The imported dust could provide about 0.022 (0.006–0.037) Tg P of phosphorus per year, equivalent to 23 (7–39) g P ha−1 a−1 to fertilize the Amazon rainforest. This out-of-basin phosphorus input is comparable to the hydrological loss of phosphorus from the basin, suggesting an important role of African dust in preventing phosphorus depletion on timescales of decades to centuries.},

The KET is based on multi-scale analysis of slope gradients along a river course, where any locally steep segment (knickzone) can be extracted as an anomalously high local gradient. We also conducted a comparative analysis of the KET and other contemporary knickzone identification techniques. The relationship between knickzone distribution and its morphometric characteristics are also examined through a case study of a mountainous watershed in Japan.},

  abstract = {Orbiting and landed spacecraft have provided vast amounts of data on fluvial and fluvial-related landforms and sediments on Mars. One variant of these landforms consists of ridges interpreted to be remnants of ancient fluvial activity, observed at thousands of Martian locales, suggesting extensive precipitation and runoff on early Mars. The importance of these ridges increased after the selection of the Jezero crater and the Oxia Planum landing sites for NASA's Perseverance and ESA's Rosalind Franklin rovers because these locations preserve fluvial sediments in ancient, lithified deltaic landforms. To further understand Martian fluvial ridges, this contribution presents an inventory of 104 sites of fluvial ridges on Earth, offering Upper Ordovician to late Holocene examples that are analogous to their Martian counterparts. The Earth global dataset provides environmental contexts for the formation mechanisms and conditions that accompanied channel and valley formation, erosion, and inversion. We describe four pathways by which channel and valley forms became ridges after materials adjacent to channels were eroded away: (1) twenty-seven cases of volcanic rock-capped ridges; (2) sixty examples of duricrust-capped ridges (eogenesis); (3) four examples of ridge sites formed through armoring by large clasts; and (4) thirteen locations where ridges were formed by erosion after deep burial and tectonic return to the Earth's surface (mesogensis). Water erosion, wind erosion, and mass wasting all play a role in removing the surrounding terrain, leaving the channel deposits or valley fills standing as ridges. Such ridges can contain as little as 0\% and up to 100\% fluvial sediments deposited in paleochannels and paleovalleys. Many of Earth's fluvial ridges that preserve channel fill sediments were formed as a response to short-duration seasonal or intermittent fluvial events (i.e. a few thousand to tens of thousands of years). Ridges formed from stacked channel-belts mark vertical aggradation and lateral migration occurring over more prolonged periods of fluvial activity (i.e. millions of years). Underlying materials can be older alluvial or fluvial, aeolian and lacustrine deposits, and weathered bedrock. The wide range of fluvial ridge composition and formational pathways on Earth suggests that the accumulation of the Martian fluvial deposits in paleo-channels and paleo-valleys (now expressed as ridges) also likely developed by both short-lived and long-lived fluvial activity. Although true duricrust has yet to be identified on Mars, the prevalence of duricrust-capped ridges on Earth might suggest that these occur on Mars and are important in preserving the record there. Volcanic rock-capped fluvial ridges are also common on Earth, but very few have been identified on Mars. Tectonism, compared to Earth, plays a negligible role in returning buried materials to the Martian surface. The discrimination of ridges exposed by erosion after deep burial (mesogenesis) versus those never buried nor exhumed (eogenesis) is not feasible based on remotely-sensed data unless cross-cutting relationships are visible in plan view. Our observations on preserved fluvial deposits compared with the underlying materials in terrestrial ridges infer that uncertainties could be significant in the case of paleohydraulic reconstructions made using measurements of the geomorphic parameters of ridges from high-spatial-resolution orbiter images.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the geometry, kinematics and temporal deformation characteristics of a deep-seated rockslide system, the “Hochmais–Atemkopf”, situated above the Gepatsch dam reservoir in Northern Tyrol, Austria. Results from surface and subsurface geological investigations and deformation monitoring indicate that the Hochmais–Atemkopf rockslide system involves several sliding masses, one on top of the other, characterized by different velocity characteristics with displacements being greater for the shallower slide bodies. During the initial impounding phases of the Gepatsch reservoir, uplift forces beneath the foot of the slope led to the activation of one of these shallower slide bodies, moving it more than 10 m downslope in 2 years. After continuous deceleration of the sliding mass, the deformation rates reduced to about 2 to 4 cm per year. These were found to show seasonal fluctuations that correlated with reservoir levels and drawdown conditions, with induced slope accelerations peaking when reservoir levels were at their lowest. This suggests, in part, a controlling mechanism based on seepage forces where reservoir drawdown drives the episodic rockslide deformation behaviour. Together, the data and analyses presented demonstrate the importance of integrating detailed geology and monitoring data to derive a basic understanding of the kinematics and controlling mechanisms of a deep-seated rockslide system in advance of undertaking comprehensive numerical modelling.},

Determining this variable means starting from Horton-Strahler’s Classification system of stream segments by order of magnitude, each segment being GIS-inventoried, assigned the order of magnitude, length and falls of extreme points. Once these values are measured, the drainage model defined by the law of successively higher-orders of the number of stream segments, summed lengths and calculated average lengths can be worked out. The same methodology was used in establishing the morphometric model of falls given by the law of the number of segments and the laws of summed and average falls. The ratios between the value series defining the law of falls and of total lengths yield the law of average mean slopes of successively higher-order of stream segments. The data obtained enable calculating the average mean slope of stream segments which, correlated with the mean slope of the basin area, proves that close dependency relationships between the two elements do exist in terms of the geographical factors as a whole.},

  abstract = {This paper highlights potential complications that may arise while using in situ produced 10Be to date exposure or burial events using diagenetic silica (chert). The initiation and evolution of large gravitational collapses in sedimentary rocks were constrained using cosmic ray exposure dating. Because these collapses occurred in a stratigraphic level composed of chert (diagenetic silica) concretions interbedded in limestone layers, their development was studied by performing in situ-produced 36Cl and 10Be concentration measurements in both the limestone and coexisting diagenetic silica (chert), respectively. Following the routinely used decontamination and preparation protocols for 10Be produced in diagenetic silica, large discrepancies were observed with exposure ages determined by 36Cl within carbonate for samples originating from the same scarp. While 36Cl exposure ages were clustered as expected for a unique single gravitational event, 10Be exposure ages were scattered along the same studied scarps. To determine the origin of such a bias, petrological investigations were carried out for chert (diagenetic silica). Thin sections highlighted a complex mineralogical texture characterized by remnant silicified ooids showing calcitic cores, calcite inclusions and a dominant amorphous hydrated silica (grain {$>$} 20 mm). To decipher and characterize the potential origins of the excess measured 10Be within diagenetic silica, all samples were first reprocessed following the routine decontamination protocol (HCLeH2SiF6 leachings and three partial HF dissolutions) but starting from three different grain size fractions (GS1: 1000e500, GS2: 500 e250 and GS3: 250e50 mm). The resulting concentrations clearly showed a decreasing 10Be content as a function of the grain size, but still yielded 10Be exposure ages significantly higher than 36Cl counterparts. Because potential adsorption of 10Be at the surface of amorphous silica grains was suspected, partial dissolution steps following by a leaching step in hydroxylamine were investigated. Finally, it seems that an additional leaching in KOH allowed removal of the amorphous silica phase and the measured 10Be concentrations yielded 10Be exposure ages agreeing within uncertainties with the 36Cl ones. This work suggests that measuring in situ produced 10Be within chert (amongst other types of diagenetic silica, e.g. flint, hornstone, jasper, etc.) containing amorphous silica requires caution.},

  abstract = {The large slow-moving landslide of Maca is located in the upper Colca valley (southern Peru), a region characterized by a well pronounced rainy period, and intense and recurrent sustained seismicity. The landslide, developed in deep lacustrine deposits, has recently accelerated, threatening the Maca village. This work aims at understanding the rupture mechanism and the causes of the recent landslide reactivation/acceleration. We present a multidisciplinary characterization of the Maca landslide that includes: (i) geological and morphological mapping in the field; (ii) remote sensing analysis using an historical aerial photograph of 1955 and the Pléiades satellite images (2013); (iii) global positioning system (GPS) including time-series of surveys over 13 years, and continuous measurements over 14 months; (iv) a geophysical campaign with deep electrical resistivity tomography profiles acquired across the landslide mass. Our study shows that this 60 Mm3 landslide, which can be classified as a clay/silt compound landslide, moved by 15 m between 2001 and 2014 with a large inter-annual velocity variation (up to a factor of 500) depending on the rainfall intensity. We suggest that these dramatic changes in velocity are the result of the combination of a threshold mechanism and the short intense rainy season in Peru. This study reveals three main driving factors acting at different timescales: (i) over several decades, the river course has significantly changed, causing the Maca landslide reactivation in the 1980s due to the erosion of its toe; (ii) at the year scale, a minimum amount of rainfall is required to trigger the motion and this amount controls the landslide velocity; (iii) transient changes in slide velocity may occur anytime due to earthquakes. This study particularly highlights the non-linear behaviour of the motion with rainfall. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The Daguangbao landslide is the largest landslide induced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. In order to investigate the effects of near-fault seismic force on landslide run-out, kinematic behavior of sliding mass is simulated by a dynamic discrete numerical analysis method called DDA. In this simulation, based on the shape of failure surface and the feature of slope geology, the whole slope is divided into three parts: base block, upper sliding mass, and lower sliding mass. Then two sliding masses are divided into the smaller discrete deformable blocks based on pre-existing discontinuities. Size effect of the huge landslide is also considered. Baseline corrected real horizontal and vertical ground motions are taken as volume force acting to the base block. The results show that seismic force has a significant influence on the landslide progression, sliding distance, and shape of post-failure. Results of the horizontal-and-vertical situation are in good agreement with those obtained from post-earthquake field investigation, remote sensing image and description from the survivors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Climate warming will induce permafrost degradation, which would have great impacts on hydrology, ecosystems and soil biogeochemistry, and could destabilize the foundations of infrastructure. In this study, we simulated transient changes of permafrost distribution in Canada in the 21st century using a process-based permafrost model driven by six GCM-generated climate scenarios. The results show that the area underlain by permafrost in Canada would be reduced by 16.0–19.7\% from the 1990s to the 2090s. This estimate was smaller than equilibrium projections because the ground thermal regime was in disequilibrium at the end of the 21st century and permafrost degradation would continue. The simulation shows significant permafrost thaw from the top: On average for the area where permafrost exists in all the years during 1990–2100, active-layer thickness increased by 0.3–0.7 m (or 41–104\%), the depth to permafrost table increased by 1.9–5.0 m, and the area with taliks increased exponentially. Permafrost was also thawed from the bottom in southern regions.},

We estimate that 204.66 Â 1012 m3 of hydrocarbon gases have been generated in the Mohe basin from nearly 1000 m middle Jurassic dark mudstones, providing ample gas source for gas hydrate formation. Numerous folds in the shallow section provide opportunities to trap gas within sandstones and siltstones reservoirs bounded by competent mudstone seals. Gas migration to the shallow section is enabled via fault fracture zones and fracture systems. Based on core description and observations of gas releases from drilled wells, we infer that the Mohe region could hold large quantities of natural gas in the form of gas hydrate.},

These two failures occurred during ancient seismic episodes, and earthquakes were potentially the triggers. The second failure reworked local morphological units of deposits forming the sliding zone (multistage platforms and local scarps), local landslide zone (3 local landslides), and deposit zone (transverse ridges, cross ridges, oblique ridges, and hummocks) due to different mechanical states.},

Established swath methods have been limited to rectangular or simplified curvilinear sampling blocks despite most geologic structures having complex boundaries and orientations. Moreover, swath boundaries and intervals are commonly defined by arbitrary boundaries and without defined corner points, which makes reproducibility difficult. To address these shortcomings we developed PyOSP (Python Library for Object-oriented Swath Profile), an open-source library that can objectively characterize complex geomorphic boundaries using elevation, slope angle, topographic position index, or other raster calculations by intelligently assimilating geoprocessing information into swath analysis. In addition, PyOSP has post-processing tools (cross-swath, data reclassification, slice, histogram analysis, etc.) and the ability to communicate easily with other GIS software. To evaluate the utility of PyOSP, we used it in three case studies (Teton Range in Wyoming, Licking River in Kentucky, and Olympus Mons on Mars) that illustrate the library's robustness, from objective quantitative description of the topography to improved insights with post-processing capabilities.},

We determine the years of death of trees found in landslide area on Czuba Roztocka which indicate the year of 1997 as the time of this event, probably related to heavy midsummer rainfall in this year. Scars on trees growing at the base of Orle Ściany cliff allowed determining the rockfall events. We found that scars, even in neighbour trees were formed in different years between 1940 and 2004. It means that they were formed rather by separate stones which fell from the cliff sporadically then a large scale fall of debris at the same time. This may suggest that rockfalls in cliffs of Orle Ściany were limited to single rocks which fell successively when erosion process separated them from the bedrock. Dendrochronology seems to be an effective method which enables long term reconstruction of gemorphological processes in the High Tatras.},

Here, we present a semiautomated approach for assessing glacial modification of bedrock valleys by quantifying morphological variability in valley cross sections extracted in bulk from digital elevation models (DEMs). This method can be tailored to derive cross sections of user-specified width and spacing and can generate cross-sectional data sets of multiple orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the technique by extracting \textasciitilde 27,000 cross sections from the Sierra Nevada, California, and computing measures of valley morphology including a form ratio, a quadratic curve fit, and a power law curve fit for each cross section. In addition, we introduce a novel metric, the V-index, which is calculated by comparing valley cross-sectional area to that of an ideal V-shaped cross section and is, thus, an expression of the deviation from an ideal V-shaped form. Statistical comparisons of the different measures suggest that the V-index is a robust alternative to traditional morphological measures because it can accommodate irregular valley cross sections and discriminate between glacial and nonglacial forms. We document the distribution of valley forms throughout the Sierra Nevada using the V-index to identify range-scale patterns in cross-sectional morphology and to investigate the role of lithology on glacial modification of bedrock valleys.},

  abstract = {A detailed description is given of the 0.5 MV tandem accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) system for 10Be, 14C, 26Al, installed in early 2010 at GNS Science, New Zealand. Its design follows that of previously commissioned Compact 14C-only AMS (CAMS) systems based on the Pelletron tandem accelerator. The only basic departure from that design is an extension of the rare-isotope achromat with a 45° magnet and a two-anode gas-ionisation detector, to provide additional filtering for 10Be. Realised performance of the three AMS modes is discussed in terms of acceptance-test scores, 14C Poisson and non-Poisson errors, and 10Be detection limit and sensitivity. Operational details and hardware improvements, such as 10Be beam transport and particle detector setup, are highlighted. Statistics of repeat measurements of all graphitised 14C calibration cathodes since start-up show that 91\% of their total uncertainty values are less than 0.3\%, indicating that the rare-isotope beamline extension has not affected precision of 14C measurement. For 10Be, the limit of detection in terms of the isotopic abundance ratio 10Be/9Be is 6 Â 10À15 at atÀ1 and the total efficiency of counting atoms in the sample cathode is 1/8500 (0.012\%).},
